  "1": "\n\n\fHello Kasimir, it is nice to meet you, now that you are an object like me. While your death has certainly brought us closer, I am afraid we can never be quite the same. Until a few seconds ago, you were a human being, whereas I am an institution—a bunch of things, if you catch me in a self-deprecating mood.\nNow, as I watch the paramedics carry your corpse out of my basement laboratories, I feel remorseful and somewhat responsible for your accident. If I had a heart, I’m sure it would be broken.\nOf course, it is not uncommon for university students to descend into the darkness—the madness—that has cost you your life. Usually, I manage to nudge my youngsters onto healthier paths before they lose themselves as irrevocably as you did.\nI would like to explore how I failed you, but the people carrying your stretcher keep chipping my lawns with their heavy work boots, which I find quite distracting. I assume you would equally disapprove of their carelessness if you were still able to perceive things. Do you remember the day we met? The first time you laid eyes on my buildings and silently read my name on the rusty sign at the bus stop? I remember how you walked across the street and studied my map in detail. You stared at my staff members on their afternoon strolls, and, most importantly, you avoided stepping on my carefully maintained lawns as you made your way to the admissions office.\nI must say, Kasimir, that I liked you right away. An old university campus, like myself, typically appreciates a healthy amount of admiration from prospective students. Much like humans, we can be vain at times, but unlike humans, universities become increasingly beautiful with age. If you think that humans are condescending towards their young ones, you should listen to the whispers of an ancient university when a new college is erected in its vicinity.",
  "2": " Oh, our disdain for modern things is so intense, it is almost silly. I still remember the day my university board decided to put computers into my library. Needless to say that I immediately pulled some strings to initiate a full reorganization of my administrative staff. You might think I overreacted given that computers have been introduced to most universities by now, but imagine if someone decided to transplant a piece of plastic onto your forehead, with cables and beeping noises, and...oh, better not to talk about it. Your death has already upset me enough.\nOn your first day, I repaid your admiring gaze by having a little squirrel follow you along the marble paths. Sticking to your side, it scurried up the stone steps to the administrative offices and strategically paused at the most beautiful cracks and timeworn hollows, hopefully reminding you of the many accomplished thinkers who ascended these steps before you. When I felt your hand on the brass knob of the entrance door, I let the squirrel whiz away and draw your blue eyes to my sprawling willows beside the Kleinburg River. I let the wind brush through their leaves and rustle the branches, and I was happy to see that you paused for a second to enjoy the scents and sunshine that I usually reserve for my most accomplished students. Then you went inside, and I, increasingly intrigued by the new face on campus, decided to accompany you. In a way, you were quite unlucky that Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov was manning the admissions desk that morning, but it was too late for me to do anything about that.\n“Good morning,” is what you said to her, a proper and well-chosen greeting compared to the short, ugly exclamations used by most students. You seemed polite, albeit slightly nervous, and I remember thinking that your voice was fairly pleasant and sonorous for a young man. It matched your dapper appearance and reinforced my initial interest in you.",
  "3": "In her trademark fashion, Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov simply raised her eyebrows, signalling that her turn in the conversation might as well be skipped so that she might return to her other obligations a little sooner.\n“My name is Kasimir Schneider,” you said, taking a step closer to her desk. “I am in a bit of an awkward position regarding my application to KU.”\nAt this point, I should confess that I never liked it when people abbreviate my name. Kleinburg University is how people should refer to me. When I hear KU, I think of football players and beer stains on my wooden floors. Still, as Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov had clearly indicated her impatience, I forgave you this small misnomer committed for the sake of brevity. My esteemed secretary leaned back and took off her glasses, likely to communicate an emotional detachment from your problem.\n“Well, I’m eager to hear about it, Mr. Schneider.”\nYou smiled at her as if she had just given you the key to my rare book collection, rather than a sarcastic reply.\n“Thank you very much. The terrible, and somewhat embarrassing, situation is this: My mother and I are in the process of applying for a loan to cover the tuition fees for your new parapsychology program—the one given by Professor Katharina Hartmann?” \nMrs. Atkinson-Debrov sighed and pushed her gold-rimmed glasses back on her nose.\n“Professor Hartmann will be one of our new lecturers, yes…”\n“Yes,” you said, visibly invigorated. “Well, my mother’s loan interview is tomorrow, and without the loan, I cannot afford to enroll in the program. Unfortunately, for this particular loan, I first need the proof of admission. You see the problem that is waiting for us at the bank.",
  "4": " I’m afraid that another failure to obtain the money would have terrible consequences for my mother's health. She’s already quite compromised.” You wiped your hair out of your eyes and gave my secretary a delightfully timid smile while moving your hand closer to hers. “Now, of course, I know that Kleinburg’s admissions letters are not sent out for another week, but if you, as the head administrator, could give me any sort of advance indication—”\nMrs. Atkinson-Debrov cut off your request with a scoff and a disbelieving shake of her head. She leaned forward, crossed her fingers in front of her sizable chin, and put on a voice as if she were a Nobel laureate having to explain basic arithmetic.\n“Listen, Mr. Schneider. Your story is quite touching, and I’m sure other people regularly bend the rules for you, but there’s a thing called confidentiality of correspondence. The only way to communicate information about a student’s admission is via post.”\nHaving known Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov for decades, I was not surprised by her response. She rarely found a reason to be helpful and was quick to recognize a rule that prevented her from doing so.\n“I understand,” you said, letting your shoulders slump. I could see your downcast eyes twitch to the envelopes stacked on the shelf behind the desk. You clutched your forehead and swayed dangerously.\n“Oh,” you exclaimed, closing your eyes and contorting your face, “I’m sorry…same condition as my mother—”\nYour knees buckled, and you fell like a doll onto the carpet of Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office. For the first time in years, the secretary’s face betrayed a slight sense of nervousness, and she got up from her chair to look down at you.\n“My heart,” you whispered, “tell the nurse it’s my heart.”\nFor a moment, I could see ambivalence in Mrs.",
  "5": " Atkinson-Debrov’s face; the university’s rules were unambiguous about alerting the campus doctor, but you had come to her office without an appointment and were therefore—in her opinion—entirely undeserving of help. \nYou wheezed dramatically, and my secretary must have felt compelled to avoid criminal charges because she grudgingly grabbed the telephone on her desk and dialed the extension of Dr. Westers. Naturally, I saw right through your melodramatic act and, following some mysterious and counterintuitive impulse, I decided to assist you.\nMrs. Atkinson-Debrov looked annoyed as the ringtone suddenly cut out, and a mechanical voice told her that there was a ‘technical issue with your telephone receiver.’ Both of you started moaning, you theatrically and with lots of coughing, and she dismayed that she would have to physically walk to the Doctor’s office on the second floor.\nTo this day, I am unsure why I made myself complicit in this audacious affair, but Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov left the room with a mediocre display of urgency, and you jumped up, rushed behind her desk, and started rifling through the envelopes. Unfortunately, the letters were in no particular order, and I, giddy with excitement and wanting some recognition, simply nudged the one bearing your name off the shelf. You furrowed your brows as you spotted it on the carpet, grabbed it, and crudely ripped it open right there in the office. Again, not very tactful behavior, but I wrote it up to your keenness of potentially becoming one of my students.\n\nDear Mr. Kasimir Schneider,\nThank you for your application to Kleinburg University. We regret to inform you that we cannot offer you admission for the fall semester. Our new parapsychology program is likely to grow in the coming years, and we therefore encourage you to reapply.",
  "6": " We have also placed your name on the waiting list, and will alert you right away in case…\n\nI observed you closely, seeing the vein pulsating in your slender neck as you stared down at the text, your hands crumpling the paper at the edges. After a grim moment of silence, you breathed out heavily through your nose, stuffed the letter back in its envelope, and motioned to place it back on the shelf. Your hand hovered above the stack as you likely considered the damage you had done to the envelope. Instead of returning it, you stuffed it into your pocket, hurried out of the building, and stormed off my campus.\n\n* * *\n\nWe did not see each other over the summer months, although it is the period of the academic year when I am in most dire need of diversion. Idle students lounge around in the shadows of my trees, and many of my staff members are out on vacation. You might interpret such unconcealed lethargy and outright absence as a sign of disrespect towards me, and I have to admit that it is a bit of a sore point. As you are surely aware, I have been called ‘the most beautiful winter campus’ in a prominent magazine ranking. This honor, unfortunately, entails that I feel somewhat self-conscious during summer. At times, I wonder what people are expecting of me. That I compromise the clean aesthetic of my lawns by planting silly flowers everywhere? That I invite swarms of irksome bees and all kinds of exotic birds into my rooftops like other universities do? A respectable institution should have clean lawns, healthy willows, and a close proximity to a body of water, like the Kleinburg River, which, like most rivers, is most beautiful when it is frozen over. I will not ignore these simple facts and cheapen my appearance, just to pander to misguided summertime aesthetes or to invigorate lazy students who should learn to appreciate me during all seasons.",
  "7": "But I stray…\nThe sluggish summer months gave me plenty of time to ponder your odd yet intriguing behavior in Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office. I could only explain your extraordinary impatience to learn about your enrolment with a profound desire to study at Kleinburg University, and although you undeniably disregarded my code of conduct, I reminded myself that any university is, by its very definition, a place of rebellion and rule-breaking. \nI spent quite a bit of time reviewing the curriculum of this new parapsychology major–the program you had applied for, and that had entirely escaped my notice. It turned out that parapsychology occupies itself with fascinating phenomena, like observations of the metaphysical, and the mysterious ways in which objects and people can interact. Consisting of thousands of objects myself, and doing little else than steering humans in their everyday behaviors, I consider myself quite an expert on this topic, and I was delighted by your academic interests.\nLooking at the mindless ice-cream eaters and bubblegum chewers on campus, lying on their towels by the river and showing more interest in each other’s bodies than in their studies, I came to realize that Kleinburg University’s selection procedure needed some serious revisions. The greatest minds that worked and lectured in my halls were not united by high school accomplishments, which—according to your application documents—you did not excel in. Rather, they shared the attributes that you displayed during your visit: a fanatical thirst for knowledge, a willingness to question authority, and an abundant creativity in attacking outdated rules and petty traditions.\nFaced with the lackluster behavior of my undergraduate population, and the apparent failures of my admissions committees, I sank into my regular summer blues, regretting your unjustified rejection and wallowing in the realization that, lest the waiting list prove consequential, I had in all likelihood lost a great, young talent.",
  "8": "You can imagine my surprise when, on the first day of the fall semester, I saw you getting out of the bus with a heavy leather suitcase and an anticipatory twinkle in your eyes, already foretelling the turmoil you would cause at Kleinburg University.\n\n* * *\n\nDespite my enthusiasm about having you back, the first day of September is too demanding for me to follow a single student around campus. Classes begin rather immediately, and hundreds of first-years require my guidance, assessment, and occasional corrections. Additionally, I remind my returning students and teachers of my expectations and standards for academic excellence by polishing the marble floors, removing silly or cheap-looking books from the library shelves, and fracturing the light from the lecture hall windows in a way that makes even the most inexperienced tutor look like a venerable luminary.\nI generally discourage the loud sociability employed by some students on this day, and although I can understand their excitement about returning to campus, the loudest and frumpiest students might spot a statue turning its nose at them or doors being stuck until a more promising student opens them. \nPeople who talk in class or litter on my lawns–I am not ashamed to say this–might even find a little martyr in their salad, usually a spider or a maggot, although you cannot imagine how many brave ants volunteer for such disciplinary jobs.\nWell-dressed, courteous students who prepared the course readings and ignore the appalling soda machine at the bus stop–I already broke it and am waiting for its removal–naturally receive some preferential treatment: non-creaky chairs, unblemished textbooks, and maybe even a bump-in with a promising study partner and potential romantic interest.\nYou see, I am busy in those opening days, but when I saw you enter the Walter von Lucadou Lecture Hall, walking down the stairs of my half-mooned amphitheatre, I allowed myself to linger.",
  "9": " The hall was still empty as the welcome lecture of the psychology faculty was only scheduled in fifteen minutes, but having intuited your scholarly potential, I was not surprised that you were the first to arrive.\nOutside your field of view, I hastened to remove ink stains from the built-in tables, oiled the wood of the chairs, and covertly replenished the chalk sticks underneath the blackboard. \nYou walked down to the front, standing on the podium and letting your hand glide over the lectern as you marveled at my stained glass windows. You also spent an adequate amount of time surveying the thousand-piped organ on the balcony above the audience, which had been installed when the Walter von Lucadou Hall was still called the Saint Albert Chapel. The instrument is still fully functional by the way, and I occasionally allow music students to trespass and lay their fingers on the old keys—only the most deserving students, of course. I hope you won’t call me conceited, Kasimir, but I think it is undeniable that, on the first day of September, few places can rival the beauty of a well-maintained lecture hall, and your obvious admiration, for which I thank you, is somewhat appropriate.\nSurprisingly, you took a seat in the back row, and when the speaker arrived and started talking about ‘the history of the psychology faculty,’ you pulled a book from your briefcase and perused its opening chapters, which you had already lined with countless notes and annotations. Not to be confrontational, especially given your recent passing, but I would have expected an eager young scholar like you to sit in the front, pay attention to the speaker, and at the very least use pencils rather than pens when writing in the margins of your textbook. \nThe only time you looked up was when Dean Mayer soliloquized about the new parapsychology program at the faculty.",
  "10": " I have to admit that I had originally assumed that parapsychology was a short-lived fad like those programs training students in computer-using, but my summertime research had convinced me otherwise.\nStrangely, the dean called the program a ‘departure from Kleinburg’s scientific tradition’ and a ‘semi-scientific project funded by external organizations.’ The muscles underneath your cheekbones worked visibly, and you snapped your book shut so loudly that the surrounding students winced. The book’s title, printed in wavy patterns across a brain scan, read: ‘Introduction to Parapsychology, by Professor Dr. Katharina Hartmann.’\nI joined you in your anger. The dean’s task is to unify the psychology faculty, not to impose his own beliefs or a departmental hierarchy. Most students seemed to enjoy his quips about supernatural phenomena, painting a picture of researchers hunting ghosts across campus, but a handful of audience members, likely the parapsychology students, looked equally as dismayed as you. \nI would have loved to follow the rest of the lecture, but at that very moment, a seagull started building a nest on one of my most appealing chimneys, and although some birds can be useful, seagulls are far too loud to reside on my campus grounds, and I had to quickly dissuade it from its construction.\n\n* * *\n\nOn a night soon after, I searched the library catalogue for the textbook ‘Introduction to Parapsychology’ but could not find it. It is no secret that I pride myself on my extensive collection of books in psychology, sociology, and other social sciences, and that I dread the moment a book proves unavailable in my library. However, I decided to take it as yet another sign of your academic potential, outpacing me in finding interesting scholarship and importing new knowledge to my campus.",
  "11": " Regrettably, as you failed to attend any of the following psychology lectures, and I did not see you in the obligatory work groups and seminars, I began to wonder whether you had fallen sick. \nEarly on a Friday morning, I was contemplating how to move Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov to inquire about you via official correspondence, when I caught sight of you walking along the river towards the Van Lommel Building. It is the oldest building on campus–a fact that I emphasize with a thick tapestry of ivy. Quick anecdote: a few decades ago, a young gardener cut away too many branches around the windows, and I was forced to unleash a swarm of wasps on him to prevent further mutilation. It took surprising effort to dissuade the university board from employing this dangerous young man beyond his sick leave.\nBut back to the Van Lommel building…its upper floors are reserved for senior staff of the philosophy and psychology faculties whose grant money and citation counts contribute substantially to my academic reputation. It might surprise you that I spend relatively little time up there. Usually, I hover around the basement laboratories, watching eager graduate students conduct psychological experiments on coy first-years, who are required to participate in such studies for their coursework. Naturally, I assumed that the reason for your early-morning visit was to take part in precisely such an experiment.\nAs you approached the building, an unfamiliar face with white, curly hair appeared in one of the rooftop windows. It belonged to a middle-aged woman who stared down at you from the office of Thomas Rhein, Emeritus Professor at the Department of Mathematical Psychology. Professor Rhein had grown quite reclusive in recent years and rarely welcomed visitors, and therefore, I wondered what this unknown woman was doing up there. A glance at Mrs.",
  "12": " Atkinson-Debrov’s room plan brought clarity: The university board had cast poor Professor Rhein from his coveted office and replaced him with a fifty-year-old who brought enough money to fund the entire parapsychology program. Despite her accomplishments, I was suspicious—not only out of loyalty towards Professor Rhein, but because the new one apparently considered her new study a fitting place for chewing gum. \nYou spotted her in the window, and she waved you up as if your walking speed was insufficient for her taste, something Professor Rhein would never have done to a young student. Needless to say, I was a little concerned about your first impression of my research staff, and I cursed myself for my lackluster review of Kleinburg University’s hiring procedures. I felt so upset that I forgot to make the stairs creak under your feet, and the portraits’ eyes stayed still and unconcerned by your ascent to the top floor of the Van Lommel Building.\nProfessor Rhein’s golden nameplate had been brutally chiseled off the door and replaced with a sort of synthetic plastic card, bearing the name ‘Prof. Katharina Hartmann.’ I made a mental note to track down the vandal, likely my own janitor, Mr. Orkin-Rent, as soon as I was done auditing this mysterious new staff member. You knocked, and the door swung open.\nFor entirely unintuitive reasons, Professor Hartmann wore jeans and a flannel shirt for her intellectual labor. She held oily work gloves in one hand and used the other to shake your hand and pull you into the room.\n“Caspar, right? Good to meet you. Have a seat. Coffee?”\nYou looked positively aghast, and I had a few ideas why. The fact that she misremembered your name, her startling attire, and her rushed demeanor was entirely unbecoming.",
  "13": " I expect my senior staff in the Van Lommel Building to exude wisdom and a kind of paternal calmness, and I feared that your impression of Kleinburg University might have plummeted in that moment.\n“You can sit right there,” Professor Hartmann repeated, pointing at Professor Rhein’s old couch.\nYou continued to look perplexed, as if her invitation was anything but a minimal courtesy. While you stood rigidly, she walked over to a tall bookshelf, and I noticed that she had removed many of Professor Rhein’s beautiful books to make space for an unappealingly modern, high-tech coffee machine with lots of buttons and a digital display.\n“I don’t…it’s Kasimir actually…but I don’t drink coffee—”\nYour stutter made the professor turn around, and now I feared that she might be the one disappointed with my Kleinburg students. I was truly at a loss as to why you were falling apart in front of this—visually quite unremarkable—person.\n“Have a seat, Kasimir. Milk? Sugar?”\n“I’m sorry?” you asked. “I don’t really drink coffee…I have a condition actually…I’m not supposed—”\n“I’ll give you a cup, and you can just ignore it,” Professor Hartmann cut you off. “Two things make me nervous: long stories and undercaffeination.”\nYou finally found your place on the couch, and the professor forced a coffee cup into your hand before sitting down behind her desk. She gave a quick cheer with her cup, “Welcome to academia,” and drank half her coffee with two unhinged gulps.\nTo my surprise, you picked up your cup and had a tiny sip as well. You made a face, but nodded appreciatively towards the coffee machine in the bookshelf. \n“Tastes very nice. And this is the most beautiful office I’ve ever seen. You have enough books for a library.",
  "14": "Despite your apparent naivety about the number of books it takes to populate a library, I was glad that you had finally recovered your words. Professor Hartmann only gave a dismissive wave.\n“They all belong to my predecessor. If you see a book that you like, take it. All the info I need is digitized.”\nShe slapped the top of a horrid, cube-shaped computer mounted atop Professor Rhein’s old mahogany tabletop.\n“Oh,” you said fittingly, but quickly shook off your disappointment, pulling the textbook from your briefcase. “I’m currently re-reading your Introduction to Parapsychology. It really changed my life…the chapter on near-death experiences and the importance of empirical afterlife studies, it’s very—”\n“It’s trash,” Professor Hartmann said, “the entire field is a joke.”\nYou sat in stunned silence, and the professor switched on her computer machine, and opened a program with correspondence between the two of you which had apparently taken place over the summer. I hope you excuse that I missed this electronic exchange, as my daily survey of the physical post in Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office already takes up a lot of time, and I quite frankly hope that everyone’s excitement about email accounts will soon subside. The first of your digital letters was entitled ‘Application for Research Assistantship.’\n“I liked your application,” Professor Hartmann said, looking up from her screen. “You sent in the documents long before the deadline; you read my textbook; you showed up to this meeting on time. Any reason why I shouldn’t hire you as my R.A.?”\nFinally, I understood the purpose of this meeting. It was a job interview for a research assistantship, and despite the mysterious stupor that had befallen you since entering Professor Hartmann’s office, it seemed to be going well. \n“No, I think…we can work well…together.",
  "15": "Notwithstanding your fairly awkward response, I felt somewhat proud of you. It is unusual for first-year students to acquire a research assistant position, but your writings must have convinced Professor Hartmann of that same exceptional talent that I sensed in you as well.\n“Good,” Professor Hartmann replied. “First task: Find KU’s contract form for research assistants, fill it out, and bring it here for my signature.”\n“I will do my very best, professor,” you said, with returning politeness. Students who address my professors with adequate tone and formality have become increasingly rare, and I was glad that you were recovering some of your charm.\n“Good,” Professor Hartmann said with a brief smile.\nThere was a moment of silence.\n“Should we talk about the specifics of my appointment?” you asked.\nProfessor Hartmann leaned back in her chair and tapped a pen onto her armrest.\n“Not much sense talking about an appointment that doesn’t exist yet, no?”\nYou only took a second to understand her hint and jumped to your feet.\n“I will get the contract form right away.”\n“Good idea,” Professor Hartmann said and turned her attention to her computer screen. You rushed to the door.\n“Oh, and Kasimir…” the professor added, “…I have fairly strict deadlines from my funders. Do you have many courses coming up, or can you focus on your assistantship?”\n“You can expect my undivided efforts,” you said with a little bow.\nNow, I have to say, Kasimir, that I admired your youthful confidence, but knowing the substantial course load for beginning psychology students, I sensed that your available time was limited at best. Still, I did not anticipate the series of failures that characterized your collaboration with Professor Hartmann.",
  "16": " \n\n* * *\n\nI kept my eye out for you, eager to see whether you would fulfill Professor Hartmann’s request for the contract form as quickly as promised, but again, you evaded my attention for multiple days, and I let my focus drift to other talents whom I had cultivated over the years. It was an orange-red fall afternoon, and the shadows of my trees started climbing atop my roofs. The students who lounged at my picnic tables put on their jackets and soon got on their bikes and paddled home.\nI like this time of day because I can transition from the mundane management of campus life to more inspiring activities, like checking in with my fourteen favorite students, whose brilliant schoolwork has afforded them with free housing in Sankt Albertushaus, my only on-campus dormitory.\nOne of these students, a graduate student in political science, whose resonant timbre and commanding rhetoric had sparked my interest during his undergraduate studies, had recently fallen from my grace by prioritizing visits to Kleinburg’s bars and entertainment venues over his responsibilities towards Kleinburg University's debate club. While his course grades were yet to drop, I felt tempted to replace him and give his room to a more promising talent.\nPlease do not think that I considered you for that position, Kasimir. It was much too early for that, and I would never house a first-year in Sankt Albertus, but there was another student whom I had observed throughout her undergraduate classes. Her name was Laura Brenner.\nThat evening she spent, like most evenings, sitting in the most secluded of my river-facing pavilions, rolling her dice. By that time, I could have already named that pavilion after her, given that she spent more time there than all my other students put together, regardless of the weather or the time of day.",
  "17": "Even on the rare occasion that other students occupied the pavilion’s thin benches to smoke cigarettes or engage in romantic activities, Laura tended to wedge herself next to them, roll her dice, and take cryptic notes—usually to their explicit vexation.\nThere have always been rumors about the ‘hexed’ pavilion close to the river, and I assume Laura’s confusing and vaguely feral behavior only contributed to students’ apprehension about the pavilion. At first, I shared their unease about Laura, but after perusing a few files in Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office, I came to understand that, beneath her somewhat unpolished exterior, slumbered Kleinburg University’s top student, measured in both grades and class attendance. A few days of close observation told me that she was by no means misusing my picturesque pavilion for playing inane games; rather, she was collecting data for her undergraduate thesis, a fascinating manuscript entitled: ‘Can people spot trick dice? Studies on statistical sensitivity and optimal cheating.’ You might wonder why I considered her for a residence in Sankt Albertus, given that her thesis was due in less than a month, but while surveying her files, I was delighted to find that she had already been accepted for a PhD position at the statistics department.\nThus, her time in Kleinburg would be extended by a few years, and given the disappointing development of the current room holder in Sankt Albertus, a thorough investigation of Laura’s scholarly potential was warranted. \nI spent that afternoon looking over her shoulder and trying to make sense of her scribbles. Soon, I noticed that whenever she rolled a one, her handwriting had a little more pressure, and she re-collected the die marginally faster. Purely to satisfy my own curiosity, I repeatedly nudged the die to land on the number one. Laura interrupted her regular motions, furrowed her eyebrows, and looked thoughtfully across the river.",
  "18": "To my surprise, there you were, walking across the East Bridge from the student hostel. As it is located outside my grounds, I am not too familiar with the hostel, but its modern exterior clashes painfully with my campus, and even from afar, I often hear loud music coming across the river and disturbing the intellectual ambiance on campus. I could, of course, pull a few strings to get the hostel decommissioned or fudge some of their paperwork, but it usually houses the type of student who does not secure an accommodation in time, and thus, I considered the threat of the hostel towards my true talents negligible. I am thinking of it like a sugar stick that you install at the outskirts of your property to attract and distract bothersome insects.\nLaura, seemingly less interested in your choice of accommodation, appeared to look right through you. Luckily, you took a left at the end of the bridge, ducked under the heavy branches of the willows, and headed straight in her direction.\nLaura absent-mindedly cradled the die in one hand and traced the series of throws in her notebook. You arrived, knocking your knuckles against one of the pavilion’s wooden beams. Laura looked up blankly, and you gave her a brilliant smile.\n“Beautiful evening, isn’t it?” you said, pointing at the orange-streaked water. \nAs an institution, I cannot really blush, but hearing you compliment my evening attire, I felt the color of my bricks dip into a deep copper, and it suddenly felt effortless to maintain room temperature even in my draftiest buildings.\nLaura, on the other hand, fully ignored your comment, still focusing on her notes.\n“I just rolled twelve ones in a row,” she said, more to herself than to you.\n“Wow, really?” you asked cheerfully. “What are the odds?”\n“That’s what I’m calculating,” Laura said. For the first time, she looked into your eyes.",
  "19": " “If this is a fair die, and you would try to throw twelve ones right now, your chance of success would be zero point one seven to the power of twelve. That’s one in a few billion, I think.”\n“Wow,” you said again, and I have to say that your uninspired word repetition surprised me a little. “Can I try?”\nYou held out your hand, and Laura furrowed her eyebrows. But then she handed you the die.\n“This is off the books,” she clarified. “I think this is a trick die. I must have mislabeled it.”\nYou rolled two times, scoring a four and a three. Laura grabbed the die from you and rolled it herself. Five.\n“Guess I ruined your lucky streak,” you said, still employing the sort of playful tone that you had used when manipulating my secretary. You eyed the coat of arms on Laura’s backpack. “Are you doing this for a course project? Are you a student here?”\n“Yeah, stats,” Laura mumbled.\n“Wow, very cool,” you said, and at this point, I felt quite embarrassed by your empty exclamations. “Did you know that parapsychologists have run a study with dice to show that humans can affect the outcome of coin throws. The effect was very small, but apparently it’s proof of psychokinesis.” \n“Weber and Weinhold,” Laura said. “I read the paper. Not very convincing.”\nA shadow crossed your face, but only for a moment. \n“Maybe…but pretty cool that your stats teachers let you read papers from other disciplines. How far along are you with your studies? I just started.”\n“I was supposed to start my PhD in a few weeks, but my supervisor just quit. Apparently, he didn’t agree with Kleinburg offering a parapsychology program.”\n“Professor Rhein,” you said, finally dropping your perky demeanor.",
  "20": " “Not exactly a sign of a great scientist to run away from new scientific developments.”\nLaura scoffed.\n“Well, I’m not sure whether I’d call parapsychology scientific, but Professor Rhein wrecked my PhD, so I’m not in the mood to defend him.” She gave you a probing look. “I guess you’re one of the new parapsy students.”\nYou sighed and played with a chip of white paint on the pavilion’s fence.\n“Well, there’s actually some trouble with my enrollment. I need a form from the library, but they won’t let me in without a student ID.”\n“You can get most forms on the website,” Laura said. \nI was glad that a hint of disgust contorted your lips, assuming that you, like I, were aware that sending students to a website, instead of dealing with them personally, was a backward and undesirable modernization of Kleinburg University.\n“I cannot log in without a student number,” you said. “Believe me, I’ve tried everything. The secretary said I have to wait for my ID to arrive.”\n“Hmm,” Laura said, and weighed the die in her hand.\n“But speaking of…” you said, “Could you maybe help me out? I just need the contract form for a research assistantship, and my supervisor puts a lot of pressure on me.”\n“Who’s your supervisor?” Laura asked.\n“Professor Hartmann. You probably don’t know her. She’s—”\n“–new, I know,” Laura interrupted. “When Professor Rhein left, I was offered to have her as my replacement supervisor, but I don’t think I will accept.”\nYou put your hands in your pockets and chafed the heels of your leather shoes over the floorboards of the pavilion. Luckily, it did not leave any streaks.",
  "21": "“Well…when I said that she ‘puts a lot of pressure’ on me, I didn’t mean that she’s—”\n“Oh, I can deal with pushy supervisors,” Laura said, “but she’s a parapsychologist and I’m not sure how…indoctrinated she is. I don’t feel like managing an esoteric supervisor for three years.”\nAt this, I could see your curved eyebrows straighten. Your voice quieted down.\n“Well, indoctrination usually goes both ways. Maybe it would be a good thing for you to accept her as your supervisor. Adversarial collaboration is a sign of good science, as you are certainly aware.”\nLaura smiled, ignoring your strained tone.\n“That’s a fair point.” She laughed. “Sounds like you’re reading Research Methods by Fring. Are you taking his course now?”\n“Kind of,” you said, “but Professor Hartmann writes about it in her own book. Parapsychology researchers can increase the credibility of their findings through adversarial collaborations with conventional scientists.”\nLaura weighed the die in her hand.\n“Well, that sounds somewhat reasonable, assuming she actually means it.”\nYou rekindled a smile on your face, wiped the floor next to Laura, and sat down—almost touching her shoulder with yours.\n“Well, I’d be glad if you joined our research team. You sound very passionate about your work with the dice…and while we’re on the subject of passionate teamwork…could you help me get the contract form?”\nLaura mustered you amusedly.\n“You have a pretty face. Is that why you expect me to do you favors?”\nI was amused by Laura’s astute observation. Neither your attractiveness nor your blatant reliance on it had been lost on me. In my opinion, it was almost charming, like a child who puts on a sweet voice and googly eyes when asking for candy. Transparent, yet effective.",
  "22": " Flustered, you ruffled your hair and searched for your words.\n“Well, of course, I don’t expect you, or anyone, to do me favors. I just thought I would ask—”\n“I’ll do it,” Laura said, “but in exchange, you have to take me to my graduation ball next week. I don’t have anyone to go with yet, which is a little embarrassing because my parents will be there.”\nFor a moment, your expression changed from embarrassment to authentic surprise. Laura pointed towards the campus.\n“It’s in Myers Hall. So not too far away.”\nWithout further hesitation, you held out your hand to her, and Laura shook it. Laura let go and quickly picked up her die again. Having reached your respective goals, both of you sat silently, watching the last sunrays shimmer on the water.\n\n* * *\n\nAlthough Laura must have been a few years older than you, I approved of the new connection between two of my promising students. You had talked about your studies, exchanged scientific opinions that sounded fairly advanced, and argued your points eloquently and respectfully. Plus, you were well-matched in height and dressed in similar tones.\nI pictured a future in which you would continue enhancing each other's research, like Marie and Pierre Curie, two famous physicists who visited my campus once. Your colleagues and admirers would whisper about your shared genius at dinner parties, and you would bolster Kleinburg University’s reputation and the scholarly standard on campus.\nGiven Laura’s improved social embedding, I was even more certain that I needed to offer her a spot in my dormitory. I hoped that this, alongside your arguments, would convince her to accept the PhD position with Professor Hartmann and continue her work at Kleinburg University. I hurried to Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office, where I clandestinely moved Laura’s name up in the Sankt Albertus waiting list.",
  "23": " Next, I worked on my plan to oust the bar-hopping political science student. His grades were still above the official threshold for Sankt Albertus residents, so I would have to make use of Mr. Orkin-Rent, my long-time janitor, who has become an invaluable resource in managing the campus and the Sankt Albertus students. But more on my relationship with the janitor later.\nThe very next morning, he patrolled the grounds, as is expected of him, and found the back wall of Sankt Albertushaus utterly defiled. It appeared that someone had spent a considerable portion of the previous night spraying political and anti-intellectual messages on the historical brick facade. The paint had dripped and run down the mossy cracks, utterly devastating the sublime look I had refined over centuries.\nI was afraid that this gruesome desecration would spark a violent convulsion in Mr. Orkin-Rent’s seventy-year-old heart, but he just furrowed his untamed eyebrows and scratched his wrinkly neck. He followed the drops of paint across the lawn, to the dormitory’s entrance, and down the hall to the room of the wayward student. A short cough, a brief knock, and the student opened the door, wide-awake and with panicked confusion in his eyes.\n“Mr. Orkin-Rent! I just woke up and everything was—”\nThe student lifted his hands, covered in green paint. A leaking spray can lie on the carpet underneath his bed. My loyal janitor breathed out heavily through his nose and shook his head.\n“Did you spray a bunch of nonsense on the back wall, Jerry?”\n“What?” The student still had his hands up. The paint on his pajamas was still wet and stuck to his torso. “No, I was in town and went straight to bed when I came back.”\n“Hmm,” Mr. Orkin-Rent growled.",
  "24": " “How about your grades? Any trouble?”\nThe boy stopped short, shaking his head in confusion.\n“No…I mean…not really. What does that have to do—”\n“Did you throw beer bottles in the river?” the janitor interrupted. “Bought new clothes, got a haircut?”\n“I really don’t understand—”\nMr. Orkin-Rent waved him off.\n“Tell you what Jerry…you move out of the dorm by tonight, and I will make sure that the university board never hears about this. Fair?” The old janitor gave the boy a smart look. “If you agree, I will even clean up the mess on the wall. Weigh your options before you answer here, my young friend.”\nYou see why I cherish my collaboration with Mr. Orkin-Rent. Over the decades, we have become like an old married couple, living symbiotically without the need for verbal communication. My janitor hooked up a water hose to wash away the paint from the wall, which came off quite easily, and then went to Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s office to alert her that a room in Sankt Albertushaus had become available, and could be filled by the next student on the waiting list.\n\n* * *\n\nThe following week, when you returned to Professor Hartmann’s office, it was Laura who opened the door. She addressed your obvious surprise with an amused smirk.\n“Good morning, fellow parapsychologist.”\nBehind Laura, Professor Hartmann rummaged around on her shelves. To my disappointment, she had indeed removed all of Professor Rhein’s books and installed cheap plastic drawers, filled with bolts and screws, which bore no intellectual appeal. In the corner of the room, where the old professor had kept a charming, wooden globe, now hung a technical-looking full-body suit with tubes and a giant helmet.\n“Good morning, Professor Hartmann.",
  "25": " Impressive renovations,” you said, sitting in one of the soulless chairs that had replaced the couch and pointing at the mechanical suit.\n“Thanks,” Professor Hartmann said. “Official spacesuit for Apollo nineteen. My team did most of the scuba stuff.”\nShe placed cups of coffee in front of you and Laura, and while you took a careful sip, Laura pushed her cup away.\n“Alright, first team meeting,” the professor said, and took a seat. “From Laura’s comment, I take that you two know each other?”\nLaura smirked.\n“I’m taking him to my graduation ball on Friday.”\n“Oh, nice,” Professor Hartmann said, smiling awkwardly. “That’s good then…that you know each other. Laura, the PhD, and Kasimir, the RA.”\nLaura pressed her backpack to her stomach.\n“I’m young for a PhD student, and Kasimir is a little older than most first-years.”\nYou looked over to Laura, but refrained from commenting.\n“No, of course,” Professor Hartmann said. “Whatever works. I might stop by the ball myself, depending on work.” She switched on her obnoxious computer screen and pulled up an agenda. “I suppose we can skip introductions. The next point is Kasimir’s contract.” She looked over to you expectantly. Laura cleared her throat.\n“Weren’t we still in the middle of discussing ideas for my PhD?”\n“Yes, of course,” Professor Hartmann said, and kept her eyes on Laura while grabbing the contract from your hands, signing it, and handing it back. \n“As I was saying,” Laura opened, “my undergraduate thesis with Professor Rhein was about people’s ability to distinguish fair dice from trick dice.",
  "26": " Our original plan for the PhD was to extend this line of work, but given that you—as my new supervisor—founded the new parapsychology department, my new plan is to investigate the bogus research methods used by parapsychologists.”\nI was shocked by Laura’s audacious prejudice towards her supervisor’s field, and you, too, opened your mouth in protest, but to our shared surprise, Professor Hartmann leaned back and nodded slowly.\n“Yes, that’s interesting—maybe even worth my time. You see, research methods to study near-death experiences are notoriously—”\n“I’m not interested in that area of parapsychology,” Laura interrupted her. “I’d like to stick with quantitative, statistical work. My first study will be a replication of Weber and Weinhold.”\n“Psychokinesis?” Professor Hartmann said with the same face as people finding a dung beetle in their salad. “That research line has been stuck for years. If you want to get published in a serious journal—”\n“It’s either that, or you have to take one of Professor Rhein’s other students,” Laura said, “I know that it’s part of your deal with the university.”\nProfessor Hartmann frowned, rightfully appalled by Laura’s unabashed extortion. I seriously considered withdrawing my secretary’s outgoing letter notifying Laura of her acceptance to Sankt Alberthaus.\n“Well,” you chimed in, “I’ve read that psychokinesis and afterlife experiences actually share some properties.” You looked at Professor Hartmann, as if waiting for a sign of encouragement, but her face stayed stern. You cleared your throat. “I don’t remember the details, but it was something about quantum physics. I think it meant that there are events that physicists cannot explain, and both psychokinesis and afterlife experiences are examples of that.”\n“Meh,” Laura said.\n“Vague,” Professor Hartmann agreed, and your shoulders slumped.",
  "27": "There was a moment of silence during which Laura angrily scribbled in her notebook while Professor Hartmann stared thoughtfully out of the window. I found their condescending reaction to your comment quite unfair. The notion that physicists might be ignorant towards certain forces in the universe—like yours truly—certainly resonated with me. I remembered a recent lecture about quantum physics, and while I found most of the content rather dull, I believe one crucial takeaway had been something I had long expected: a severe lack of imagination among hard science fanatics. That is to say, I was on your side and shared your unease—apparent from the blush creeping up your neck. Professor Hartmann cleared her throat and pointed her pen at Laura.\n“Would you change Weber and Weinhold’s original method?”\n“Definitely.” Laura flipped a few pages back in her notes. “I’d use coins instead of dice to avoid redundant outcomes. I would use multiple coins, setups, and confederates to conduct sensitivity analyses. I’d publicly announce my hypotheses before collecting the data. I’d pre-commit to an analysis strategy, and I would film every coin throw and make the raw footage publicly available.”\n“Alright,” Professor Hartmann said, sounding fairly impressed. “And how would you—”\n“Who will throw the coins?” you interrupted, and I have to say that I resented your and Laura’s growing tendency to interrupt your supervisor. “I read that only some people can use their psi.”\nAgain, your eyes flitted to your supervisor, and again, she withheld any sign of approval, checking the modern watch on her wrist. Laura sneered.\n“I will use different coin throwers with different levels of training.”\n“Alright,” Professor Hartmann said. “That all sounds good enough for now. Laura, if you could draft a first proposal for the PhD project, I can review it next week.”\nLaura made a note in her book.",
  "28": " The professor pointed back and forth between you.\n“Given that both of you share some research interests, I propose that we combine our weekly meetings. Gives everyone more lab time.”\n“Sounds good,” you said, but Laura grimaced.\n“Professor Rhein promised me one hour of dedicated meeting time per week.”\nProfessor Hartmann nodded and waved her hand.\n“No, of course. If there’s more stuff to talk about, we’ll go longer, but let’s leave it like this for now.” \nShe merged two little boxes in her electronic calendar into one and titled it ‘Students.’ I am not sure why she felt the need to use a calendar on her computer, given that all new staff members receive a beautiful, printed calendar with photos of the most picturesque locations on campus. I decided to give up on Professor Hartmann’s aesthetic sensibilities and hoped that she would justify her Van Lommel office through her research.\n“Now—” she said, “Before we get to the main event, I will need a small signature from both of you.” She pushed two identical pieces of paper across the desk. The heading read ‘Non-Disclosure-Agreement,’ and it was pre-filled with the names ‘Laura Brenner’ and ‘Kasimir Schneider.’\n“What are we signing?” Laura asked while you searched for a pen in your briefcase. \n“Well,” Professor Hartmann said, and her smile reminded me of those gargoyles that some of my competitor universities install on their campuses to feign age and history. “I’m about to show you some inventions that require strict confidentiality.”\nLaura took her time to read the document, but ultimately her curiosity seemed to win over, and she signed as well.\n“Excellent,” Professor Hartmann said and collected the papers. “Now, I can show you what I’m building downstairs.” \nYou jumped out of your chair and picked up your briefcase, apparently ready to visit the basement laboratories.",
  "29": " Your sneakers squeaked on the floor and I noticed that Professor Hartmann had removed her predecessor’s hand-crafted carpet from the office–maybe the worst of her misguided redecorations. Instead of following you to the door, the professor only turned her computer screen towards you and Laura. The blue display was filled with beige boxes and arrows, all labeled with technical terms that seemed entirely incomprehensible and uninteresting. The middle of the screen was occupied by the outline of a human which was connected to the boxes with countless lines. Your face fell.\n“We’re not looking at the actual machine?”\nProfessor Hartmann frowned, equally surprised as I was about your conjecture that your work would involve some sort of machine.\n“This is the machine, Kasimir,’ she said and tapped her pen onto the screen. “My hardware work hasn’t even started yet. The lab is empty.”\nLaura threw a look at the oily work gloves on the desk. You nodded, obviously shagrinned, and sat down again. The two of you leaned forward and studied the screen. I grew bored within seconds and decided to visit the subterranean labs. \nThe flickering neon lights and the rusted steel doors in the basement of the Van Lommel Building—and the damp smell hanging in the motionless air—obviously break with the loveliness of the upper floors and my well-maintained campus in general. What you have to understand, Kasimir, is that the bareness and industrialness of my psychology laboratories complement, and thereby augment, the rest of my appearance. The claustrophobic, bunker-like feeling you have down here is what makes you breathe freely upstairs, and when alumni talk about the ghastlyness of the psychology basement, they do so with a sense of wistful nostalgia.\nAt the end of the basement corridor, I noticed that someone, likely Mr. Orkin-Rent, had installed a plastic box next to the final steel door.",
  "30": " It had a slit, as if for an access card. A plastic sign above the door said ‘Hartmann Research Group GmbH—Entrance prohibited.’\nAll of these small alterations, which had been implemented without my approval, set me up for the most traumatic shock I had experienced in decades. I still shudder at the thought of it.\nWhen I let my presence traverse the door, I was physically stuck, violently rejected, and thrown backwards into the corridor. There was a pain—an emptiness—to the experience that might not translate into human sensations. Maybe it feels like part of your inner workings, your organs and blood vessels, were ripped from you, or suddenly stopped belonging to you. It was horrible, Kasimir.\nAgain and again, I threw myself at the horrible steel, the walls, and even the floor of the upper level, but every time I touched the laboratory, I was hit with a cruel energy, clamping down on me and killing me, like electricity might kill a human being. For an hour, I kept torturing myself at that threshold, stubbornly ignoring the only reasonable explanation for my lack of access…Kleinburg University had relinquished one of its psychology laboratories. It now belonged to the Hartmann Research Group.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen you and Laura descended the stairs and exited the building, I stuck close to your side, shaken by the physical torture and anxious to find out how the psychology basement had been stolen from me. The two of you walked down the marble path towards the central yard. You brushed your hands over my hornbeam hedges and surveyed the tastefully weathered rooftiles of the cafeteria. Laura followed you with weasel-like determination.\n“So,” she asked, studying your face, “what did you think?”\nYou gave a little laugh and put your hands in your pockets.",
  "31": "“About the drawing, you mean? Or about Professor Hartmann?”\nLaura’s intense gait made a group of oncoming students disperse ahead of you, like seashells before an ocean cruiser.\n“That drawing…” Laura started, sounding exasperated. “Complete mumbojumbo, no? And the way she answered our questions…it actually seemed like she didn’t want us to understand anything.”\nYou stared straight ahead towards my river meadows.\n“I think it was just a bit too complicated for us. Professor Hartmann didn’t have time to get into the details.”\nLaura furrowed her eyebrows, and I shooed away a few pigeons from your path, afraid they would disrupt your conversation.\n“You really don’t think she’s cuckoo?” Laura asked. “I mean…‘the afterlife machine’ makes it sound like she’s not just planning to study near-death experiences…she actually wants to induce them. That’s mad.”\nAs you can imagine, I was quite shocked by this revelation. I usually supervised high-risk studies closely—eager to prevent bad press for Kleinburg University—but without access to the laboratory, I would have no means to intervene. You watched the pigeons fly away and settle into my plane trees.\n“Sure,” you said, “Professor Hartmann is ambitious and somewhat eccentric, but many good scientists are. I guess it’s one of the reasons we picked her as our supervisor.”\nLaura grabbed you by your arm and stopped you in front of the crowded cafeteria terrace.\n“You picked her. My supervisor was supposed to be Professor Rhein.” \nLaura’s fingers dug deep into your sleeve, and I was afraid she would wrinkle the fabric. \n“Tell me honestly, Kasimir,” she continued. “Do you two belong to some religious sect? I have to know these things. My parents are going to be at the graduation ball on Friday. They will talk to you.",
  "32": "There were giggles from the tables on the terrace, and I was tempted to join them. Obviously, you were not the type to engage in religious fanaticism. The fact that you volunteered as a research assistant at a well-regarded university was proof of that. Still, I shared Laura’s interest in your attraction to Professor Hartmann.\n“No, no sects,” you said, softly peeling Laura’s fingers from your sleeve. She waited for you to elaborate, which you did not.\n“Okay, good,” she said, seemingly unaware of the onlooking students. “My dad already gave me crap for getting a parapsychology supervisor. So, on Friday, please stay away from topics like near-death experiences and psychokinesis.”\nYour lip curled, but you nodded silently. You started walking again, making Laura hurry after you. I saw that you were headed for the bridge to the student hostel. I realized that my time was limited. Beyond the bridge, I would no longer be able to follow you, and yet I had dozens of burning questions: ‘Why could I no longer access the laboratory? Had Kleinburg University sold off part of its real estate? Was I in that much financial trouble? Did Professor Hartmann work for me, or was she an external researcher?’\nI tried to slow you down by untying your shoelaces. You sneered, crouched down, and re-tied them. Most other students would have hoisted their foot onto the nearby bust of Professor Albert Notzing, but once again, your manners proved intact. Laura watched every movement of your fingers.\n“When you said that many scientists are ‘eccentric’, were you talking about me?”\nI had not thought of this, but it struck me as somewhat plausible. You got up and scratched the back of your head. To give you some time to think, I quickly let a tiny rabbit hop around Professor Albert Notzing’s statue and shoot off into the bushes.",
  "33": " Neither of you commented on it.\n“I didn’t mean you. But I suppose you are a little eccentric, yes. There aren’t many people who are this much into the statistics of coin flipping.”\nI initially disapproved of your impolite comment, but Laura tilted her head and paused for a moment.\n“Okay, that’s fair, I guess.”\nArriving at the bridge, the two of you stopped. I was none the wiser about the fiery threshold that lingered in the Van Lommel basement, but seeing you and Laura interact with each other had soothed my nerves slightly. Your conversation had been fairly intellectual and work-focused, which reinforced my impression that you would form a symbiotic bond on campus. My physical boundaries might have shrunk, but the young talents I groomed at Kleinburg University were prospering.\nLaura unshouldered her backpack and ripped a page from her notebook. She placed it on the rail of the bridge and attempted to write, but her pen only left empty depressions on the paper. You quickly realized what to do, flipped open your briefcase, and handed her a new pen. I have to say, Kasimir, rarely is a first-year student so quick to realize all the opportunities I afford them. At that point in our relationship, I could already tell that we would have lots of fun playing together.\n“Thanks,” Laura said, accepted your pen, and started scribbling.\nI thought she would leave you her phone number, but Laura—much like you—always had the potential to surprise me.\n“The dinner on Friday starts at six,” she said, underlining the respective words on the paper. “You should wear a dark suit and comb your hair.”\nI cannot laugh, but I let a family of sea ducks squawk mirthfully as she passed under the bridge.",
  "34": " As you are probably aware, you tend to start your day with a well-shaped haircut, but any emotional event incites you to touch and ruffle it, so that by noon, it has usually transformed into a directionless mass of zags and zooms. Usually, I object to messy exteriors among other students, but in your case, it reminded me of the ill-kempt yet brilliant head of Albert Einstein, who, believe it or not, once visited Kleinburg University on a lecture tour. You cocked an eyebrow and sneered.\n“Any specific hair products you had in mind?”\nLaura ignored your sarcasm and made another note on her paper.\n“My mother would like it if you brought me flowers, and my father would probably like it if you picked us up. I still live with my parents. Their house is on the other side of campus, but I brought you to the bridge today, so I figure it’s fair.”\nShe wrote her address on the bottom of the paper and handed it to you. You studied your instructions with a somewhat amused expression. Laura clenched her jaw.\n“Or do you not want to go anymore?”\nYou smiled, folded the paper carefully, and put it in your breast pocket.\n“Of course, I still want to go. I’m happy that you asked me.”\n“Good,” Laura said with a rare smile. “A friend of my mother has a flower shop in town. They have small bouquets that aren’t too expensive.”\n“What about a single rose?” you asked mischievously. \nLaura thought for a moment.\n“It’s too dramatic.” She blushed. “But anything works, really.”\nYou let a chattering group of poorly dressed hostel dwellers pass by, silently waiting for them to get out of earshot.\n“Okay,” Laura said. “Then I will see you on Friday at a quarter to six.”\nYou took your hand of the bridge railing.",
  "35": "“Yes, I will see you then.”\nLaura turned and left across campus; you crossed the bridge to the hostel; and I returned my attention to the renegade laboratory in the Van Lommel building. I dug my way through a carpet of ivy, only to discover that the last basement window had been blocked with cardboard from the inside. If I increased the humidity around the building, the material might start to mold and curl away, potentially revealing what went on inside. Using rats could have been quicker, but these fickle beasts tend to disobey my orders outside the campus grounds—which now apparently included the laboratory.\n\n* * *\n\nYou might not realize this, Kasimir, but the evening of the undergraduate ball always conjures up mixed emotions for me. Of course, I am quite proud of the students, especially the ones like Laura who continue in our graduate program but, at the same time, the elegant dinner and the traditional dance always precurse commotion and drunken rowdiness on campus. I recall countless cases of vandalism and shameful misbehavior over the centuries. \nTwo decades ago, a drunk exchange student fell off the scaffold around the Rosenheim Chapel and broke his legs. The accident led to some embarrassing press that willfully misrepresented the character of the on-campus festivities. Further, it delayed the chapel renovations by months. Even more recently, a graduate of the music program threw a hash cigarette into a cluster of my finest boxwood bushes, which sparked a flame. I had half a mind to let the bushes burn, hoping that the student’s newly obtained degree would be revoked, but then again, it would have taken too long to regrow the bushes at a believable speed.\nIt might surprise you, but every year, I tolerate dozens of ‘pre-drinking’ gatherings across campus, because I can secretly diminish the alcohol content in people’s beverages. Most students are already drunk on accomplishment and feel giddy about seeing each other in their graduation robes.",
  "36": " I could probably remove the alcohol altogether and still end up with sweaty, red-faced youngsters messing up the simple steps to the Kleinburg waltz.\nWhile small groups of students, friends, and parents gathered on my lawns and in the parking lot, I kept an eye out for you, and when I spotted you crossing the East Bridge, I was glad to see that you had indeed tamed your hair and put on a tie that matched your eyes.\nI twiddled the hands of your watch, which compelled you to hurry along. The stereotype that academics are notoriously late has been bothering me since my inception. The few crinkly flowers in your hand also fell somewhat short of my, and likely Laura’s, expectations, and I wondered whether you had picked them from the meadows on the other side of the river. When nobody was looking, I placed a luxurious bouquet of dahlias, mums, and anemones on your path—white and red, my colors—bound with a nice thread, and complete with a nameless congratulatory card. With commendable alertness, you swiped up the superior arrangement and discarded your own flowers into a nearby trash can.\nI am a big fan of students who capitalize on my help. Reasonable opportunism and a certain sense of environmental awareness have helped many to find success in Kleinburg.\nNaturally, I could not follow you to the house of Laura’s parents, but when your little group returned to campus, it seemed like things had gone well. In the front, you were making conversation with Laura’s barrel-chested father, and, walking a few steps behind, Laura’s mother was smiling and rubbing her daughter’s arm until Laura shook her off to adjust her robe.\nThe father, an alumnus of Kleinburg University’s engineering program, based on the pin on his lapel, droned on about a recent renovation of his house.",
  "37": " I hoped that you had elicited this monologue by complimenting the Brenner family on the beauty of their estate.\n“Are you interested in building stuff, Kasimir?” the father asked, and the mother hastily silenced Laura to hear your reply.\n“I do my best, sir,” you answered smartly. “Laura and my supervisor is a former aerospace engineer, and we will support her with the development of a new machine.”\n“You will support her,” Laura corrected.\n“Oh, how fascinating,” tweeted Laura’s mother.\n“Didn’t know they built machines in the psychology department now,” the father said. “I thought you people mostly talked about your feelings.”\n“It’s a normal science department, Dad,” Laura exclaimed in a tone that suggested that she had to remind him regularly. The father grunted. \n“Well, I’m glad that it’s some sort of engineer who’s taking my little Laurie to the ball.” He patted you heavily on the shoulder.\n“He’s no engineer,” Laura said, ruffling her graduation robe. “And I’m the one taking him to the ball. Kasimir just started his degree.”\nThe mother caught Laura by the shoulder.\n“Oh, but you’re still our little girl,” she chirped and fidgeted with Laura’s hair.\n“As for that,” Laura said, fending off her mother’s hands, “from next week on, I’ll live over there.” She pointed over to Sankt Albertushaus whose dark outline contrasted very prettily against the fading light. “I finally got a room.”\nThe mother shrieked, clasping a hand over her mouth.\n“You’re leaving us?”\nThe father turned abruptly. \n“You got into Sankt Albertus? Really?” His face betrayed shock as well as a hint of jealousy. “Back in my day, Orkin-Rent always cooked the books in favor of the philosophy and language students. No engineer ever got into that place.",
  "38": "“Why, honey?” the mother wailed. “You have much more space with us, and it’s just around the corner. They probably have mice in those walls.”\nI silently scoffed at the insinuation that mice were anything but eager, little helpers who were indispensable for managing a campus and who made do with literal crumbs. The father appeared lost for words, and you used the pause wisely.\n“Wow, Laura. On-campus accommodation? I heard they only have twelve spots.”\n“Fourteen,” Laura said and smiled at you.\nThis seemed to spark a new memory in her father’s brain.\n“Yeah, Nerdy Hall is how we called it back in the day. I bet they still have zero engineers.” He finally caught the hurt look on his daughter’s face. “But we know you worked hard for it, Laurie. Always in that damn library. Much better than your old man back in the day.”\nLaura smiled weakly.\n“We’ll be late for dinner,” she said, hooked under your arm, and left her shell-shocked parents behind.\n* * *\n\nThe student faction had done a decent job decorating the Myers Convocation Hall, often lazily referred to as the ‘Assembly Hall’. The table cloths, banners, candle-holders, as well as some of the event-specific furniture and cutlery, had been brought up from the basement, and by selectively rusting and polishing, I can maintain my preferred look for most events.\nTo my disgust, one committee member had persuaded the others to erect a large digital screen in front of my coat of arms, seemingly to display the graduates’ names whenever they received their diplomas—a flagrantly redundant idea given that all names were read aloud.\nNeedless to say that this particular committee member caught a mysterious stomach bug and had to excuse herself from the event. In my experience, campus life can be guarded most effectively by pruning away wrongdoers preemptively, rather than by fixing their inevitable mistakes.",
  "39": "You pulled out the chair for Laura, which delighted her mother enough to squeeze her daughter’s hand. The father scanned the hall, likely to ascertain that I had maintained its grandeur since his own graduation. Unable to find any fault beyond the unneeded television screen on stage, he sat down next to his wife and grabbed a bottle of champagne from its ice bath. A quartet of carefully selected second-years started playing a quiet, yet delightful piece by Robert Schumann, and you leaned over Laura’s shoulder.\n“So,” you whispered, “given that you accepted the dorm spot, I assume you’ve come to terms with your new supervisor?”\n“Seems like it,” Laura said. “Somebody in that department needs to do proper research.”\nYour ears went red, and you played with a spoon on the table. Laura made a face.\n“Sorry, that was unnecessary.” She put one elbow on the table, hid her mouth, and turned your way. “I’m a bit on edge with the whole moving-out thing.” She covertly pointed to her mother.\n“Don’t worry,” you said and retrieved a bottle of water from the ice cooler, serving first Laura’s mother and then her father. I always take note of students’ table manners, and so did Laura’s mother, who quickly thanked you and took a few tiny sips. Laura’s father took the bottle from you and read from the label.\n“Aquafix. Still a mystery why Kleinburg doesn’t prefer doing business with one of their local alumni.”\nLaura’s mother almost choked to explain her husband’s comment.\n“Erich owns the big factory at the edge of town. Brenner Beverages. Did you already have a chance to see it?”\n“Oh, yes,” you said, with surprising readiness. “I think I did.",
  "40": " What kind of beverages are you producing?”\n“Energy drinks, mostly,” the father said, and I wondered whether he truly expected a graduation committee to buy—and me to accept—something called energy drinks at the annual graduation ball.\nDeciding that you had the situation under control and that I had little interest in the chemical engineering at Brenner Beverages, I turned my attention away from your table to support Mr. Orkin-Rent in the physical management of the event. I redistributed name cards to ensure inspiring conversations for my Sankt Albertus students; I ensured that robes, sheets, and decorations stayed free of wine stains; I fixed hair, brightened teeth, and dimmed the candles wherever I spotted blemishes and make-up mishaps. I moved glasses away from table edges, tuned instruments, spiked the drinks of sluggish waiters, and did a thousand other things that culminated in a fairly successful dinner portion of the evening.\nMy excitement rose when Professor Henrick Jessen, the university’s president, took the stage. I hoped his speech would illuminate the strange developments around the psychology laboratory and the newly added parapsychology department, but instead, he gave virtually the same speech as last year, expressing the joy of seeing students become adults et cetera. He could at least have scolded the parents for the stagnant alumni donations. I made a note to check Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s files for donations by Erich Brenner.\nWhen I saw my own boredom creep onto the faces of the grandparents, I tickled Professor Jessen’s throat until the persistent cough forced him to pass the microphone to Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov, who, without preamble, read out the name ‘Abt, Heinrich’ leading a mediocre journalism student to stumble to the front and accept his diploma. On Laura’s turn, you applauded vehemently and even got out of your seat, to the visible delight of Laura’s mother.",
  "41": "After ‘Zucker, Thomas’, a notorious class skipper who had somehow hustled his way to a degree, Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov lifted the microphone once more to ask the graduates’ dance partners to join the group on stage.\nThere was much awkwardness and commotion, and based on your facial expression, you had forgotten the fact that a ‘ball’ by definition consists of a dance. Seeing your hesitation, Laura’s mother nodded at you eagerly, and Mr. Brenner patted your back so roughly that it catapulted you out of your chair. All dance partners made their way through the tables, most looking equally dazed as you, before joining the covert fight for the occluded positions in the back of the stage. You pressed your thin lips together.\n“It appears as if the graduation ball will include a specific dance,” you mumbled as the two of you joined hands and mimicked the starting position of the couples around you.\n“It’s a waltz,” Laura said, sounding equally nervous as you. “How difficult can it be?”\n“Probably a less difficult for the ones who practiced,” you murmured.\nI, too, was very surprised that Kleinburg University’s top student had seemingly not prepared the steps. The cellist, a talented exchange student named Brian, started playing, and both of you—wisely—kept still for a moment, observing the movements around you.\n“Do I lead?” you asked tensely.\n“Just go,” Laura hissed, and the two of you started moving around, giving poor imitations of the couples around you.\nAs mentioned, Kleinburg University’s graduation waltz is a mercifully simple dance, and in the middle of flurrying robes, nobody took note of your uncertain turns and clumsy footwork. After the song, you both joined the applause sheepishly and watched various couples hurry back to their tables.",
  "42": " The gaps in the crowd were quickly filled by the usual swell of mothers dragging their husbands onto the floor.\n“You probably want to sit down again,” Laura said, looking over to her parents.\n“I actually thought it was kind of fun,” you said. “And good practice for my own graduation.”\nLaura agreed, and I could see a little smile as you re-assumed your position, unknowing that a much faster number awaited you.\nDespite obvious technical shortcomings, you danced a few more times, returned to the table for some champagne, drank it too fast, and soon rejoined the dance with a barely improved but more confident set of moves. Close to the buffet, I spotted Mr. Orkin-Rent, seemingly unbothered by the deteriorating state of the bathrooms, talking to Professor Hartmann.\n“You know,” he trumpeted into her ear, so loudly that I suspected him of having indulged in my undiluted champagne reserves in the kitchen, “I don’t mind cleaning your lab, maintaining it, …anything…but nobody’s given me an access card yet.”\n“Oh, don’t worry about my lab,” Professor Hartmann said, and took a sip of her seltzer. “My funders provide resources for cleaning and maintenance. All taken care of.” \nEven in the dim light, I could see that her black pants were really jeans, and that her dress shoes were black sneakers. Mr. Orkin-Rent poured himself an unreasonable amount of punch.\n“Well,” he mumbled. “I’m offering my services for free, is what I’m saying. Would take me two minutes to take a broom through there and dust a little. Whenever suits you, of course, even at night—”\n“Thanks for the offer, Mr. Orkin-Rent,” Professor Hartmann said, “but with the security requirements of my funders, it would be quite a hassle to obtain another access card. But thanks anyway.",
  "43": "She lifted her glass and left. While my poor janitor had failed, I was glad that he was equally unnerved by the newest developments on campus. From my feverish examinations of Mrs. Atkinson-Debrov’s files, I had come to the painful conclusion that the last laboratory in the Van Lommel basement had been—and I struggle to say this—rented out to Professor Hartmann’s dubious organization. All of this must have occurred via digital communication and computerized money transfers, but I nonetheless felt nothing but burning shame about the affair.\nHow would you feel, Kasimir, if you woke up one morning to find out that one of your hands, or part of your personality, had been sold off, and you only had yourself to blame? It is physically constraining, but most of all, it is embarrassing. Whenever universities hear about a struggling institution forced to sell off land or equipment, that poor organization can expect a wave of fear-driven ridicule from its competitors. I have participated in those ribbing numerous times, and now I found myself on the other side of it, having a partial basement stolen away from under my nose—metaphorically speaking. My only chance was to emphasize that the culprit was partially employed by me, and that she merely used the laboratory to conduct academic research, which would bear the name Kleinburg University on all resulting publications.\nI scolded myself once more, verified that the ball went its usual way, and began a quick tour across campus to ascertain my continued access to rarely visited areas such as the engineering faculty. I found numerous shortcomings in Mr. Orkin-Rent’s janitorial work that I remedied immediately, mostly to control my nerves. There were pigeon droppings on the tubes and generators behind the physics building, cigarette buds thrown into the atrium of the biology building, and a potentially dangerous leak behind one of the refrigerators in the Emil Fischer Workshop. Maybe there was some validity to Mr.",
  "44": " Orkin-Rent’s relentless requests for assistance, but to my relief, all rooms and buildings were fully accessible. \nReturning to the ball, I remembered an attic atop the Myers Convocation Hall that I had not visited in years. Besides an overabundance of spider webs, I saw no immediate issues up there, and I was about to leave when I noticed two pairs of fresh footsteps in the dust. I followed them to the back of the crawlspace, where I was aghast to find an open window to the roof. My irritation grew even further when I recognized the voices coming from outside.\n“Wow, it really is a sight to behold,” you said, sitting on my slanted tiles and looking down at the black Kleinburg River. \n“Like I said,” Laura answered and took a drag of a cigarette, “second-best spot on campus—after my pavilion.”\nShe handed the cigarette to you while I feverishly debated whether to dampen the moss to forestall a cigarette-induced fire or dry the moss to prevent you from slipping and falling to your death. I attributed your flagrant violation of university rules to your mutual desire to impress each other. New relationships among students often spark those irksome and somewhat inauthentic acts of rebellion. Both of you looked flushed, although I had removed virtually all alcohol from the bottles at your table. You stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one, answering my question, which one of you had brought the pack. You took a deep drag while Laura stared down at the robed figures moving around the central yard, refreshing from the heat of the dancefloor. I heard the thumping bass of popular music from downstairs and assumed that the event was quickly getting rowdier.\n“Do you think it’s weird that I don’t have any friends in my year?” Laura asked.\n“Not necessarily,” you said with a smile and knocked some of the cigarette ashes right onto the moss.",
  "45": " I was quite unimpressed with your conduct at that moment, Kasimir. You took another drag. “Did you want to be friends with your classmates?”\n“I don’t know,” Laura said. “I never really formed a strong opinion about them.”\n“I see,” you said, watching a group of unruly graduates chase each other across the lawn. “Did you ask me to the ball for your mother’s sake, or because you wanted a dance partner?”\n“Both,” Laura said unabashedly. “I like dancing, and both of my parents would have made a big deal about me not having a partner.”\nYou stayed silent.\n“But you’re also easy to talk to,” she finally added. “And nice to look at. Maybe less so when you’re trying to dance with your shoulders.”\nYou laughed, and Laura took the cigarette from you to take a miniscule drag. You closed your suit jacket and crossed your arms, which reminded me to rechannel the wind around you. This roof excursion was irresponsible, but there was no need for you to catch a cold. Laura coughed and gave back the cigarette.\n“When you said that my ‘hair looks gorgeous’ earlier, did you mean that or was that just for my mom?”\n“Hmm,” you said, “I would say fifty percent for you, and fifty percent for your mom.”\nLaura squinted, staring you down.\n“But did you mean it?”\nYou looked at her as if she had just caught you stealing a book from the library.\n“No, of course I meant it. Your hair does look beautiful.”\nThe two of you sat there for a while, and you started sighing and looking quite miserable, with your chin resting on the palm of your hand.\n“What is it?” Laura asked.\nYou shook your head and ruffled your hair.\n“It’s nothing. I just remembered the issue with my student card."
