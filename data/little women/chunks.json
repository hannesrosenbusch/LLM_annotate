  "1": "\n\n\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying\non the rug.\n\n\"It's so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\ndress.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things,\nand other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an injured\nsniff.\n\n\"We've got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth contentedly,\nfrom her corner.\n\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\ncheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,--\n\n\"We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She\ndidn't say \"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of\nfather far away, where the fighting was.\n\nNobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,--\n\n\"You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this\nChristmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and\nshe thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are\nsuffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little\nsacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;\" and Meg\nshook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she\nwanted.\n\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\nthat. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\nto buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long,\" said\nJo, who was a bookworm.\n\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\nwhich no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\n\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"\nsaid Amy decidedly.\n\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\ngive up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\nI'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels\nof her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\n\n\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\nI'm longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\nagain.\n\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo.",
  "2": " \"How would you\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\nfly out of the window or cry?\"\n\n\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\ntidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\nso stiff, I can't practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough\nhands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\n\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don't\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\nknow your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\nhe isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\n\n\"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\npapa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\n\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\nproper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,\nwith dignity.\n\n\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\npapa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\nif we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\n\n\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\nspite of their money.\"\n\n\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\nwe make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\n\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\nthe long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\nhands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\n\n\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\n\n\"That's why I do it.\"\n\n\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"\n\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\n\n\"'Birds in their little nests agree,'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\n\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.",
  "3": " It didn't matter so much\nwhen you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\nhair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\n\n\"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\na chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\nenough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\nmanners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\nworse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\nonly stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the\nblue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\nbounded across the room.\n\n\"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\nall the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\nits touch.\n\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and\nprim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\ngoose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\nof speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\nas bad as Jo's slang.\"\n\n\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\nready to share the lecture.\n\n\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one\ncontradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.\n\nAs young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\nold room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\na good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\npleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.",
  "4": "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\nmuch in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\nfunny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\nwoman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\ndisturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\nleast. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\non her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\nyoung lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\nsisters were we will leave to be found out.\n\nThe clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\nof slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\neffect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\nto welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\nof the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\nas she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\n\n        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\n\n\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\n\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\n\n\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\n\n\"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\nslippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\ngone.",
  "5": "\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth; \"let's each get her something\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\n\nEvery one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\n\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\n\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\n\n\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\nmuch, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\n\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\nDon't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\n\n        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\n                     turn to sit in the big chair]\n\n\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big\nchair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\npresents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said\nBeth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\n\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\nher. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\ndo about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,\nwith her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\n\n\"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\n\"dressing-up\" frolics.\n\n\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\nactress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\nboards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\nthe fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\n\n\"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.",
  "6": " If I can go down\neasily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\ngraceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned\nAmy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\nwas small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\n\n          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\n\n\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\ncrying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'\" and away went Jo,\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\n\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\nherself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more\nsuggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\na despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\nburn as she watched the fun, with interest.\n\n\"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\naudience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.\"\n\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of\ntwo pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful\nincantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;\nRoderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of\nremorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\nrubbed his elbows.\n\n\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're\na regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\nsisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\n\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\nOperatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\nif we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\npart. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'\" muttered Jo, rolling her\neyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\n\n\"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\nbread. Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\ngeneral burst of laughter.",
  "7": "\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a\n\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\nthe world.\n\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\ngetting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\ndinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\ntired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"\n\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,\nher warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to\nher lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\n\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\nhappy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\n\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped\nher hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her\nnapkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"\n\n\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\nthe cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\n\n\"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\ntreat.\n\nBeth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\n\n\"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\ntoo old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\nwarmly.",
  "8": "\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\n\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\n\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\nher voice.\n\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\nminute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"\n\nThey all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\nshould happen to be touching.\n\nVery few letters were written in those hard times that were not\ntouching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little\nwas said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\nhomesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\nlively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\nat the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\nlonging for the little girls at home.\n\n           [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\n\n\"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\nday, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\nat all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\nremind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\nneed not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\nthey will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\nfight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\nbeautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\nthan ever of my little women.\"\n\nEverybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\ngreat tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\nthe rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\nand sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\nso he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by.\"\n\n\"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to\nwork, but won't any more, if I can help it.",
  "9": "\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\nrough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\n\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\nthat father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\ncoming home.\n\n        [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]\n\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress\nwhen you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me\ntie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks\nand rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the\ncellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\nCelestial City.\"\n\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\npassing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!\" said Jo.\n\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,\"\nsaid Meg.\n\n\"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our\nflowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for\njoy up there in the sunshine,\" said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant\nmoment had come back to her.\n\n\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\ntop. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\nat the mature age of twelve.\n\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\nplaying all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\nwhich is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\nbefore father comes home.\"\n\n\"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\nliteral young lady.",
  "10": "\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\nthink she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\n\nBeth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\n\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\nbe good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\n\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled\nus out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,\nlike Christian. What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo, delighted with\nthe fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her\nduty.\n\n\"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your\nguide-book,\" replied Mrs. March.\n\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then\nout came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls\nmade sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no\none grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into\nfour parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\nand in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the\ndifferent countries as they stitched their way through them.\n\n   [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\n                                 piano]\n\nAt nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a\nway of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the\nmost pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could\nlisp\n\n        \"Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\"\n\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the\nhouse singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\nlullaby.",
  "11": "      [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]\n\n\n\n\n                   [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]\n\n                                   II.\n\n                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\n\n\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\nit was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\nwords written by their mother, which made their one present very\nprecious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\ncoming day.\n\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\n\n\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\nme through the day.\"\n\nThen she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\n\n\"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\nhard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\nexample.\n\n\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.",
  "12": "\"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\n\n\"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\nstraight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\ngivin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah, who\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\nall more as a friend than a servant.\n\n\"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\n\"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the little flask\ndid not appear.\n\n\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\nfirst stiffness off the new army-slippers.\n\n\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\n\n\"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\nMarch.' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.\n\n\"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\ninitials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\n\n\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\nno one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\n\n\"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\nand steps sounded in the hall.\n\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\nall waiting for her.\n\n\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\nearly.\n\n\"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\ncame. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\n_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\nmore.",
  "13": "As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\nornament the stately bottle.\n\n\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\nminute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\n\nAnother bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\ngirls to the table, eager for breakfast.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read\nsome, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope\nyou will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far\naway from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six\nchildren are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\nno fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\ntell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give\nthem your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\n\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\nminute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\n\n\"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"\n\n\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\nBeth, eagerly.\n\n\"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving\nup the articles she most liked.\n\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\nbig plate.\n\n\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"\n\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\nno one laughed at the queer party.\n\n                 [Illustration: The procession set out]\n\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\nragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.",
  "14": "How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!\n\n\"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\ncrying for joy.\n\n\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.\n\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\nthere. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother\ntea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\ndressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The\ngirls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\nfed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\nunderstand the funny broken English.\n\n\"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things, as they ate,\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.\n\nThe girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\nvery agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever\nsince she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\n\n\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\n\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\nquite an elegant air to the table.\n\n\"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for\nMarmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to\nthe seat of honor.\n\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\nescort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\nlittle notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\nhandkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\npronounced a \"perfect fit.",
  "15": "There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\nwork.\n\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\nwits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\nwhatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\nrevels.\n\nNo gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\nIt was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\nspent in less profitable society.\n\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\nmost flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\nexcitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.\n\n\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\ndistance.",
  "16": " This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\non it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\ncloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\nkill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need\nthee!\"\n\n[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\n\nOut came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\n\n        \"Hither, hither, from thy home,\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n         Born of roses, fed on dew,\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\n         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"\n\n            [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]\n\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--\n\n         \"Hither I come,\n          From my airy home,\n        Afar in the silver moon.\n          Take the magic spell,\n          And use it well,\n        Or its power will vanish soon!\"\n\nAnd, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\nvanished.",
  "17": " Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\nmocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\nboots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\nof the play.\n\nA good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when\nit became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got\nup, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to\nthe ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,\nand behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver\ndress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,\nred cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.\nKneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.\nZara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came\nthe grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five\nsteps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she\ncrept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was\nabout to leap gracefully down, when, \"Alas! alas for Zara!\" she forgot\nher train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,\nfell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!\n\nA universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\nwreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so! I told you\nso!\" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed\nin, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--\n\n\"Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!\"--and, ordering Roderigo up,\nbanished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\nshaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\ngentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she\nalso defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\nof the castle.",
  "18": " A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them\naway, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech\nhe ought to have made.\n\nAct third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to\nfree the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees\nhim put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little\nservant \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall\ncome anon.\" The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and\nHagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,\nthe \"minion,\" carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\nthe poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long\nwarble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching\nand stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has\ndone in a song of exquisite power and melody.\n\nThis was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought\nthat the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred\nthe effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and\nwith great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was\nconsidered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put\ntogether.\n\nAct fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\nhimself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\nthe dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\ninforming him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if\nhe will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\nrapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his\nlady-love.\n\nAct fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\nwishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a\ntouching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands\nher hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\ngesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to\nbear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a\nletter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The\nlatter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\npair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The\nbag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the\nstage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter.",
  "19": " This entirely\nsoftens the \"stern sire\": he consents without a murmur, all join in a\njoyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive\nDon Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\n\n  [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing]\n\nTumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the\ncot-bed, on which the \"dress-circle\" was built, suddenly shut up, and\nextinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\nthe rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\nwith laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,\nwith \"Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\nsupper.\"\n\nThis was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,\nthey looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to\nget up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was\nunheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was\nice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and\nfruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,\nfour great bouquets of hot-house flowers!\n\nIt quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and\nthen at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\n\n\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy,\n\n\"It's Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\n\n\"Mother did it\"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard\nand white eyebrows.\n\n\"Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\nsudden inspiration.\n\n\"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\n\n\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into\nhis head? We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\n\n\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\nodd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;\nand he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\nallow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\nthem a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you\nhave a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,\nand I wish we could get acquainted.",
  "20": " He looks as if he'd like to know us;\nbut he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when\nwe pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt\nout of sight, with \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" of satisfaction.\n\n\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\nasked one of the girls. \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's\nvery proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his\ngrandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and\nmakes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't\ncome. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\"\n\n\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\nfence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so\non,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some\nday; for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\n\n                [Illustration: We talked over the fence]\n\n\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I've no\nobjection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought\nthe flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure\nwhat was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\nhearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own.\"\n\n\"It's a mercy you didn't, mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\n\"But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps\nhe'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?\"\n\n\"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\" And Meg\nexamined her flowers with great interest.\n\n\"They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\n\nBeth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\nbunch to father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we\nare.\"\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n  [Illustration: Eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe\"]\n\n                                  III.\n\n                           THE LAURENCE BOY.\n\n\n\"Jo! Jo! where are you?\" cried Meg, at the foot of the garret stairs.",
  "21": "\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above; and, running up, Meg found\nher sister eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe,\"\nwrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny\nwindow. This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\nhalf a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\nof a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\ncheeks, and waited to hear the news.\n\n\"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\nto-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\nproceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\n\n\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\nlittle dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\nwhat _shall_ we wear?\"\n\n\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\nbecause we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\n\n\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I'm\neighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\n\n\"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\nYours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\nWhatever shall I do? the burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.\"\n\n\"You must sit still all you can, and keep your back out of sight; the\nfront is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\nwill lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\nmy gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\n\n\"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall\nhave to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about\ndress.\n\n\"You _must_ have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves\nare more important than anything else; you can't dance without them, and\nif you don't I should be _so_ mortified.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing; it's no\nfun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\n\n\"You can't ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\nso careless. She said, when you spoilt the others, that she shouldn't\nget you any more this winter.",
  "22": " Can't you make them do?\" asked Meg\nanxiously.\n\n\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained\nthey are; that's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage--each\nwear one good one and carry a bad one; don't you see?\"\n\n\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\ndreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\n\n\"Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking\nup her book.\n\n\"You may have it, you may! only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.\nDon't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher\nColumbus!' will you?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me; I'll be as prim as I can, and not get into any\nscrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me\nfinish this splendid story.\"\n\nSo Meg went away to \"accept with thanks,\" look over her dress, and sing\nblithely as she did up her one real lace frill; while Jo finished her\nstory, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\n\nOn New-Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\nplayed dressing-maids, and the two elder were absorbed in the\nall-important business of \"getting ready for the party.\" Simple as the\ntoilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\nand talking, and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the\nhouse. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch\nthe papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\n\n        [Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]\n\n\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.\n\n\"It's the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\n\n\"What a queer smell! it's like burnt feathers,\" observed Amy, smoothing\nher own pretty curls with a superior air.\n\n\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\nringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.\n\nShe did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\nhair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of\nlittle scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\nmy hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\nforehead.\n\n\"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\neverything.",
  "23": " I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\nmess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\nregret.\n\n\"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\non your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\nseen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\n\n\"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\ncried Meg petulantly.\n\n\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"\nsaid Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\n\nAfter various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\nunited exertions of the family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on.\nThey looked very well in their simple suits,--Meg in silvery drab, with\na blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with\na stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for\nher only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one\nsoiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite easy and fine.\" Meg's\nhigh-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not\nown it, and Jo's nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her\nhead, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant\nor die!\n\n\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\ndaintily down the walk. \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven,\nwhen I send Hannah for you.\" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice\ncried from a window,--\n\n\"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding,\nwith a laugh, as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\nwere all running away from an earthquake.\"\n\n\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady\nis always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied Meg,\nwho had a good many little \"aristocratic tastes\" of her own.\n\n\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\nright? and does my hair look _very_ bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\nthe glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing-room, after a prolonged prink.\n\n\"I know I shall forget.",
  "24": " If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind\nme by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her\nhead a hasty brush.\n\n\"No, winking isn't lady-like; I'll lift my eyebrows if anything is\nwrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,\nand take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to any\none: it isn't the thing.\"\n\n\"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music\ngay?\"\n\n             [Illustration: Mrs. Gardiner greeted them]\n\nDown they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties,\nand, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them.\nMrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them\nover to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\nease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\ngossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\nas much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\nlads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\nlonged to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\nShe telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\nthat she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\ngroup near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\nat once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\nhave guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\nred-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\nher, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\nherself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\nsame refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\nto face with the \"Laurence boy.\"\n\n           [Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\n\n\"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.\n\nBut the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\nstartled,--\n\n\"Don't mind me; stay, if you like.",
  "25": "\"Sha'n't I disturb you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\n\n\"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"\n\nThe boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\nbe polite and easy,--\n\n\"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\nwas rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\nwhen he brought the cat home.\n\nThat put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\nheartiest way,--\n\n\"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"\n\n\"Grandpa sent it.\"\n\n\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\n\n\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\n\n\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,\"\nreturned the young lady.\n\n\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\n\n\"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"\n\n\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\n\n\"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\ninstead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\n\n\"I thrashed 'em.\"\n\n\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\n\n\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\nthought the name suited her.\n\n\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and every one is\nlively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\npeople's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief, and\nlet Meg sail about. Don't you dance?\"\n\n\"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\ninto company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\n\n\"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\ndescribe their travels.\"\n\nLaurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\nset him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\nthe boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\nholiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\n\n\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo.",
  "26": " \"Did you go to Paris?\"\n\n\"We spent last winter there.\"\n\n\"Can you talk French?\"\n\n\"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"\n\n\"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\n\n\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\" said Laurie\ngood-naturedly.\n\n\"How nicely you do it! Let me see,--you said, 'Who is the young lady in\nthe pretty slippers,' didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is\npretty?\"\n\n\"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\nquiet, and dances like a lady.\"\n\nJo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\nstored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,\ntill they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\noff; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\nlifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than\never, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\nto the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\n\n\"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\nteeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\nand altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?\"\n\nIt was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask; but she checked herself in\ntime, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way.\n\n\"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your\nbooks,--no, I mean studying hard\"; and Jo blushed at the dreadful\n\"pegging\" which had escaped her.\n\nLaurie smiled, but didn't seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,--\n\n\"Not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway.\"\n\n\"Aren't you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\nhad imagined seventeen already.\n\n\"Sixteen, next month.\"\n\n\"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.\"\n\n\"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way\nfellows do either, in this country.\"\n\n\"What do you like?\"\n\n\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.",
  "27": "Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows\nlooked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by\nsaying, as her foot kept time, \"That's a splendid polka! Why don't you\ngo and try it?\"\n\n\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\n\n\"I can't; for I told Meg I wouldn't, because--\" There Jo stopped, and\nlooked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\n\n\"Because what?\" asked Laurie curiously.\n\n\"You won't tell?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\nfrocks, and I scorched this one; and, though it's nicely mended, it\nshows, and Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You may\nlaugh, if you want to; it is funny, I know.\"\n\nBut Laurie didn't laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the\nexpression of his face puzzled Jo, when he said very gently,--\n\n\"Never mind that; I'll tell you how we can manage: there's a long hall\nout there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please\ncome?\"\n\nJo thanked him, and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when\nshe saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was\nempty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\nWhen the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\nand Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\nHeidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\nJo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\nsofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\n\n              [Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\n\n\"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\nwrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\ngoing to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\n\n\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I\ndon't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\nnight,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\n\n\"I can't have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I\ncan't get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it's a long\nway to the stable, and no one to send.\"\n\n\"I'll go.",
  "28": "\"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for\nthe house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest\ntill Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Laurie; he will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\noccurred to her.\n\n\"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these\nslippers with our things. I can't dance any more; but as soon as supper\nis over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes.\"\n\n\"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather.\"\n\n\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't\nstir!\"\n\nSo Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\nto the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and\nopening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little\nprivate refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\nwhich she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\nbad as the back.\n\n\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\nby scrubbing her gown with it.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a\nfull cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\n\n\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and some one\nshook me; and here I am, in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\ndismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\n\n\"Too bad! I was looking for some one to give this to. May I take it to\nyour sister?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it\nmyself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\n\nJo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\nlittle table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and\nwas so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \"nice boy.\"\nThey had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the\nmidst of a quiet game of \"Buzz,\" with two or three other young people\nwho had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose\nso quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation\nof pain.\n\n\"Hush! Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's nothing.",
  "29": "I turned my foot a little, that's all\"; and limped up-stairs to put her\nthings on.\n\nHannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\ndecided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\nhappened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;\nand Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she\nsaid, came up, and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\ncome for him, he said.\n\n\"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved,\nbut hesitating to accept the offer.\n\n\"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It's all\non my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"\n\nThat settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\naccepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah\nhated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they\nrolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\nelegant. Laurie went on the box; so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\ngirls talked over their party in freedom.\n\n\"I had a capital time. Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\nmaking herself comfortable.\n\n\"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to\nme, and asked me to come and spend a week with her, when Sallie does.\nShe is going in the spring, when the opera comes; and it will be\nperfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\nup at the thought.\n\n\"I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from. Was he\nnice?\"\n\n\"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red; and he was very polite, and I\nhad a delicious redowa with him.\"\n\n\"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit, when he did the new step. Laurie\nand I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?\"\n\n\"No; but it was very rude. What _were_ you about all that time, hidden\naway there?\"\n\nJo told her adventures, and, by the time she had finished, they were at\nhome.",
  "30": " With many thanks, they said \"Good night,\" and crept in, hoping to\ndisturb no one; but the instant their door creaked, two little\nnight-caps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out,--\n\n\"Tell about the party! tell about the party!\"\n\nWith what Meg called \"a great want of manners,\" Jo had saved some\nbonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the\nmost thrilling events of the evening.\n\n\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\nfrom the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown, with a maid\nto wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica, and\nbrushed her hair.\n\n\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\ndo, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight\nslippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"\nAnd I think Jo was quite right.\n\n                  [Illustration: Tell about the party]\n\n\n\n\n     [Illustration: The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach]\n\n                                  IV.\n\n                                BURDENS.\n\n\n\"Oh dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\" sighed\nMeg, the morning after the party; for, now the holidays were over, the\nweek of merry-making did not fit her for going on easily with the task\nshe never liked.\n\n\"I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time; wouldn't it be fun?\"\nanswered Jo, yawning dismally.\n\n\"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\nseem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and\ndrive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people,\nyou know, and I always envy girls who do such things; I'm so fond of\nluxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the\nleast shabby.\n\n\"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble, but shoulder our\nbundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt\nMarch is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\nlearned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so\nlight that I sha'n't mind her.\"\n\nThis idea tickled Jo's fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg\ndidn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,\nseemed heavier than ever.",
  "31": " She hadn't heart enough even to make herself\npretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her\nhair in the most becoming way.\n\n\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\nmidgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\nshutting her drawer with a jerk. \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\ndays, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\nand sour, because I'm poor, and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\nIt's a shame!\"\n\nSo Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\nat breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to\ncroak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\nherself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her\nlessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers; Jo _would_\nwhistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy\ntrying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the\ngrumps, for being up late didn't suit her.\n\n\"There never _was_ such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper\nwhen she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot-lacings, and sat down\nupon her hat.\n\n\"You're the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum,\nthat was all wrong, with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\n\n\"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\ndrowned,\" exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten,\nwhich had scrambled up her back, and stuck like a burr just out of\nreach.\n\nJo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed, because she\ncouldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.\n\n\"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I _must_ get this off by the\nearly mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\" cried Mrs.\nMarch, crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter.\n\nThere was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\nhot turn-overs on the table, and stalked out again. These turn-overs\nwere an institution; and the girls called them \"muffs,\" for they had no\nothers, and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold\nmornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy\nshe might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor things got no\nother lunch, and were seldom home before two.",
  "32": "\"Cuddle your cats, and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee;\nwe are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular\nangels. Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\nwere not setting out as they ought to do.\n\nThey always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\nalways at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\nthat; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\n\n\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\nbitter wind.\n\n\"Don't use such dreadful expressions,\" said Meg, from the depths of the\nvail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\n\n\"I like good strong words, that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching\nher hat as it took a leap off her head, preparatory to flying away\naltogether.\n\n\"Call yourself any names you like; but _I_ am neither a rascal nor a\nwretch, and I don't choose to be called so.\"\n\n\"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross to-day because you can't\nsit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make\nmy fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and\nhigh-heeled slippers and posies and red-headed boys to dance with.\"\n\n\"How ridiculous you are, Jo!\" but Meg laughed at the nonsense, and felt\nbetter in spite of herself.\n\n\"Lucky for you I am; for if I put on crushed airs, and tried to be\ndismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can\nalways find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but\ncome home jolly, there's a dear.\"\n\nJo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for\nthe day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\nturn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\nhard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\n\nWhen Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate\nfriend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward\ntheir own support, at least.",
  "33": " Believing that they could not begin too\nearly to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\nconsented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\nspite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\nplace as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\nsaid, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She\nfound it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\ntime when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\nof any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\nwas very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\nfriends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\nall she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\ncaught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\nlively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\nmerry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\nwould have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\nsense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\nshe had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\nalone can make life happy.\n\nJo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\nperson to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\nof the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\noffer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\nall chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\nunworldly Marches only said,--\n\n\"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\nkeep together and be happy in one another.\"\n\nThe old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\nat a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\nthe old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\ndid not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\nappeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\nirascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\nmarched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\nalways cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\nthat she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\nold lady.\n\nI suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,\nwhich was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died.",
  "34": " Jo remembered\nthe kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\nwith his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\nhis Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\nthe street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\ntall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\nwilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\nlibrary a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\nhappiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\nheart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\nadventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!\nJosy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\npoodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.\n\n          [Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]\n\nJo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\nidea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\nride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\nshe received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\"\n\nBeth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she\nsuffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home,\nwith her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\nfaithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\nloved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\nbee.",
  "35": " There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\nBeth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\nwhole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\nin; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\ndolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\nor blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\nmost repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\nan affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\nbelonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\nthe rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\ntaken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\nlittle cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\ndeficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\nthis chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\nbreathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\nwent to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I\nhope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.\"\n\nBeth had her troubles as well as the others; and not being an angel, but\na very human little girl, she often \"wept a little weep,\" as Jo said,\nbecause she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved\nmusic so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\nat the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\nhint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\nBeth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\nwhen she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\nnever was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\nsaid hopefully to herself, \"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\ngood.",
  "36": "There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\nsweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.\n\nIf anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had\naccidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\nfall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\ncould not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\n\n\"Little Raphael,\" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for\ndrawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing\nfairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her\nteachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\nslate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\non; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\nout of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\nwell as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\ndeportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\ngood-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\naccomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\nthe words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did\nso-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered\n\"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.\n\nAmy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\nclothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\ngood, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\npurple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.",
  "37": "\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that\nmother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\nParks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful; for sometimes she is\nso bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When\nI think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat\nnose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"\n\nMeg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of\nopposites, Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\nthoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\nexercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\nwere a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\nher keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they\ncalled it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\nthe maternal instinct of little women.\n\n\"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm\nreally dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together\nthat evening.\n\n\"I had a queer time with aunt to-day, and, as I got the best of it, I'll\ntell you about it,\" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \"I was\nreading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for\naunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\nfury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\n\n            [Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\n\n\"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\n\n\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\nthink them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\nfinds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\nand read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I'd just got to\nwhere they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out\nloud.",
  "38": " Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\nto read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\nshe only said,--\n\n\"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\n\n\"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\nOnce I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\n'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am; sha'n't I stop now?'\n\n\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me\na sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,--\n\n\"'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss.'\"\n\n\"Did she own she liked it?\" asked Meg.\n\n\"Oh, bless you, no! but she let old Belsham rest; and, when I ran back\nafter my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that\nshe didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall, because of the\ngood time coming. What a pleasant life she might have, if she only\nchose. I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich\npeople have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\" added Jo.\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Meg, \"that I've got something to tell. It isn't\nfunny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came\nhome. At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the\nchildren said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and\npapa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking\nvery loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed\nme, so I shouldn't see how red their eyes were. I didn't ask any\nquestions, of course; but I felt so sorry for them, and was rather glad\nI hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.\"\n\n\"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than\nanything bad boys can do,\" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her\nexperience of life had been a deep one. \"Susie Perkins came to school\nto-day with a lovely red carnelian ring; I wanted it dreadfully, and\nwished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr.\nDavis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies,\nmy eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing.",
  "39": " We were\nlaughing over it, when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he\nordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was _parry_lized with fright,\nbut she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did? He took her by the\near, the ear! just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation\nplatform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding that slate so\nevery one could see.\"\n\n          [Illustration: He took her by the ear! by the ear!]\n\n\"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?\" asked Jo, who relished the\nscrape.\n\n\"Laugh? Not one! They sat as still as mice; and Susie cried quarts, I\nknow she did. I didn't envy her then; for I felt that millions of\ncarnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy, after that. I never, never\nshould have got over such a agonizing mortification.\" And Amy went on\nwith her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue, and the successful\nutterance of two long words in a breath.\n\n\"I saw something that I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\ndinner, but I forgot,\" said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in\norder as she talked. \"When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.\nLaurence was in the fish-shop; but he didn't see me, for I kept behind a\nbarrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter, the fish-man. A poor woman came\nin, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do\nsome scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her\nchildren, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a\nhurry, and said 'No,' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking\nhungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the\ncrooked end of his cane, and held it out to her. She was so glad and\nsurprised, she took it right in her arms, and thanked him over and over.\nHe told her to 'go along and cook it,' and she hurried off, so happy!\nWasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\nslippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'\"\n\n           [Illustration: Mr.",
  "40": " Laurence hooked up a big fish]\n\nWhen they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\nand, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\n\n\"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\nvery anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should\nbe, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I\nkept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some\nclothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked\npoor and tired and anxious.\n\n\"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked; for the note he brought was not\nto me.\n\n\"'Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and\nI'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital,' he\nanswered quietly.\n\n\"'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said, feeling\nrespect now, instead of pity.\n\n\"'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any use;\nas I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'\n\n\"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give\nhis all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man, and thought it\ntoo much, while he gave four, without grudging them. I had all my girls\nto comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say\n'good by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my\nblessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\nthanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"\n\n\"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this. I like\nto think about them afterwards, if they are real, and not too preachy,\"\nsaid Jo, after a minute's silence.\n\nMrs. March smiled, and began at once; for she had told stories to this\nlittle audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\n\n\"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and\ndrink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and\nparents, who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\" (Here\nthe listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew\ndiligently.",
  "41": " \"These girls were anxious to be good, and made many\nexcellent resolutions; but they did not keep them very well, and were\nconstantly saying, 'If we only had this,' or 'If we could only do that,'\nquite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things\nthey actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could\nuse to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel discontented, think\nover your blessings, and be grateful.'\" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as\nif about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not\ndone yet.)\n\n\"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were\nsurprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money\ncouldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses; another\nthat, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth,\nhealth, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady, who\ncouldn't enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as it was to\nhelp get dinner, it was harder still to have to go begging for it; and\nthe fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good\nbehavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings\nalready possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\naway entirely, instead of increased; and I believe they were never\ndisappointed, or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.\"\n\n\"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories\nagainst us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\" cried Meg.\n\n\"I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort father used to tell us,\" said\nBeth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.\n\n\"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more\ncareful than ever now; for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,\" said\nAmy morally.\n\n\"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do, you just say\nto us, as old Chloe did in 'Uncle Tom,' 'Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!\ntink ob yer marcies!'\" added Jo, who could not, for the life of her,\nhelp getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took\nit to heart as much as any of them.\n\n                     [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                   V.\n\n                           BEING NEIGHBORLY.",
  "42": "                    [Illustration: Being neighborly]\n\n\"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\" asked Meg, one snowy\nafternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber\nboots, old sack and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the\nother.\n\n\"Going out for exercise,\" answered Jo, with a mischievous twinkle in her\neyes.\n\n\"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It's\ncold and dull out; and I advise you to stay, warm and dry, by the fire,\nas I do,\" said Meg, with a shiver.\n\n\"Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and, not being a pussycat,\nI don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm going to\nfind some.\"\n\nMeg went back to toast her feet and read \"Ivanhoe\"; and Jo began to dig\npaths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon\nswept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came\nout; and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the\nMarches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the\ncity, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large\ngardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one\nside was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of\nthe vines that in summer covered its walls, and the flowers which then\nsurrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly\nbetokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach-house\nand well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely\nthings one caught between the rich curtains. Yet it seemed a lonely,\nlifeless sort of house; for no children frolicked on the lawn, no\nmotherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and\nout, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\n\nTo Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace,\nfull of splendors and delights, which no one enjoyed. She had long\nwanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the \"Laurence boy,\"\nwho looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\nbegin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\nplanned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been seen\nlately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a\nbrown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden,\nwhere Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.",
  "43": "\"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His\ngrandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all\nalone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\nand lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\"\n\nThe idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things, and was always\nscandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \"going over\" was\nnot forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try\nwhat could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sallied out\nto dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused, and took a survey.\nAll quiet,--curtains down at the lower windows; servants out of sight,\nand nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand\nat the upper window.\n\n\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"poor boy! all alone and sick this dismal\nday. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snow-ball, and make him look out, and\nthen say a kind word to him.\"\n\nUp went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\nface which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\nbrightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and\nflourished her broom as she called out,--\n\n\"How do you do? Are you sick?\"\n\n                [Illustration: Laurie opened the window]\n\nLaurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven,--\n\n\"Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\"\n\n\"Nothing; it's as dull as tombs up here.\"\n\n\"Don't you read?\"\n\n\"Not much; they won't let me.\"\n\n\"Can't somebody read to you?\"\n\n\"Grandpa does, sometimes; but my books don't interest him, and I hate to\nask Brooke all the time.\"\n\n\"Have some one come and see you, then.\"\n\n\"There isn't any one I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head\nis weak.\"\n\n\"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet,\nand like to play nurse.\"\n\n\"Don't know any.\"\n\n\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.\n\n\"So I do! Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\n\n\"I'm not quiet and nice; but I'll come, if mother will let me. I'll go\nask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\"\n\nWith that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering\nwhat they would all say to her.",
  "44": " Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at\nthe idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as Mrs.\nMarch said, he was \"a little gentleman,\" and did honor to the coming\nguest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying\nto tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen servants, was\nanything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided\nvoice, asking for \"Mr. Laurie,\" and a surprised-looking servant came\nrunning up to announce a young lady.\n\n\"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door\nof his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and\nquite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three\nkittens in the other.\n\n\"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly. \"Mother sent her love,\nand was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some\nof her blanc-mange; she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats\nwould be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse,\nshe was so anxious to do something.\"\n\nIt so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing; for, in\nlaughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable\nat once.\n\n\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\nuncovered the dish, and showed the blanc-mange, surrounded by a garland\nof green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\n\n\"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly, and wanted to show it.\nTell the girl to put it away for your tea: it's so simple, you can eat\nit; and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\nWhat a cosy room this is!\"\n\n\"It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don't\nknow how to make them mind. It worries me, though.\"\n\n\"I'll right it up in two minutes; for it only needs to have the hearth\nbrushed, so,--and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so,--and\nthe books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the\nlight, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you're fixed.\"\n\nAnd so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\ninto place, and given quite a different air to the room.",
  "45": " Laurie watched\nher in respectful silence; and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat\ndown with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully,--\n\n\"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big\nchair, and let me do something to amuse my company.\"\n\n\"No; I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\naffectionately toward some inviting books near by.\n\n\"Thank you; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\ntalk,\" answered Laurie.\n\n\"Not a bit; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\nnever know when to stop.\"\n\n\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal, and sometimes goes\nout with a little basket?\" asked Laurie, with interest.\n\n\"Yes, that's Beth; she's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\n\n\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\n\n\"How did you find that out?\"\n\nLaurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see, I often hear you\ncalling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking\nover at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg\nyour pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the\ncurtain at the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are\nlighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all\nround the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it\nlooks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't\ngot any mother, you know;\" and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little\ntwitching of the lips that he could not control.\n\nThe solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\nShe had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\nand at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was\nsick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and\nhappiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very\nfriendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--\n\n\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as\nmuch as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come\nover and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and\nBeth would sing to you if _I_ begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg\nand I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd\nhave jolly times.",
  "46": " Wouldn't your grandpa let you?\"\n\n\"I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, though he\ndoes not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\nafraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening more\nand more.\n\n\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\na bother. We _want_ to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\nso long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\nacquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\n\n\"You see grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\nhappens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and\nI have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as\nI can.\"\n\n\"That's bad. You ought to make an effort, and go visiting everywhere you\nare asked; then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go\nto. Never mind being bashful; it won't last long if you keep going.\"\n\nLaurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\nbashfulness; for there was so much good-will in Jo, it was impossible\nnot to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\n\n\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\nlittle pause, during which he stared at the fire, and Jo looked about\nher, well pleased.\n\n\"Don't go to school; I'm a business man--girl, I mean. I go to wait on\nmy great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.\n\nLaurie opened his mouth to ask another question; but remembering just in\ntime that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\naffairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good\nbreeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him\na lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot\nthat talked Spanish, and the library where she revelled. Laurie enjoyed\nthat immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came\nonce to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll\nhad tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head\nin to see what was the matter.\n\n                [Illustration: Poll tweaked off his wig]\n\n\"Oh! that does me no end of good.",
  "47": " Tell on, please,\" he said, taking his\nface out of the sofa-cushion, red and shining with merriment.\n\nMuch elated with her success, Jo did \"tell on,\" all about their plays\nand plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting\nevents of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to\ntalking about books; and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved\nthem as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\n\n\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so\nyou needn't be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\n\n\"I don't believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\nadmiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be\na trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\nmoods.\n\nThe atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way\nfrom room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;\nand so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,\nand pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined\nwith books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\ncabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and\nqueer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,\nwith quaint tiles all round it.\n\n\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,\nand gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\nLaurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\nimpressively.\n\n\"A fellow can't live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head, as he\nperched on a table opposite.\n\nBefore he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\nalarm, \"Mercy me! it's your grandpa!\"\n\n\"Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\nreturned the boy, looking wicked.\n\n\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should\nbe. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for\nit,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.\n\n\"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\nafraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I\ncouldn't bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\n\n\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.",
  "48": "\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\"\nsaid Laurie.\n\n\"Don't mind me. I'm as happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.\n\nLaurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\nstanding before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door\nopened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, \"I'm sure now\nthat I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\nmouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\nHe isn't as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her\ngreat dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\n\nPoor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\nto beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a\nminute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,\nand the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out\nof the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living\neyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted\nones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a\ngood deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman\nsaid abruptly, after that dreadful pause, \"So you're not afraid of me,\nhey?\"\n\n\"Not much, sir.\"\n\n\"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\n\n\"Not quite, sir.\"\n\n\"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?\"\n\n\"I only said I thought so.\"\n\n\"But you like me, in spite of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, sir.\"\n\nThat answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook\nhands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\nface, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying, with a nod, \"You've\ngot your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. He _was_ a fine\nman, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\nI was proud to be his friend.\"\n\n           [Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]\n\n\"Thank you, sir;\" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited\nher exactly.\n\n\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\nquestion, sharply put.\n\n\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;\" and Jo told how her visit came\nabout.\n\n\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\nperhaps.",
  "49": " We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\nfor we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said Jo\neagerly.\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut! that was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?\"\n\n\"Doing nicely, sir;\" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all\nabout the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than\nthey were.\n\n\"Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother\nsome fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea-bell; we have it early, on\nthe boy's account. Come down, and go on being neighborly.\"\n\n\"If you'd like to have me, sir.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't;\" and Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\nwith old-fashioned courtesy.\n\n\"What _would_ Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\nwhile her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story\nat home.\n\n\"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\ngentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a\nstart of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his\nredoubtable grandfather.\n\n\"I didn't know you'd come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\nlittle glance.\n\n\"That's evident, by the way you racket down stairs. Come to your tea,\nsir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy's hair by\nway of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\nseries of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\nexplosion of laughter from Jo.\n\nThe old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but\nhe watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and\nthe change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light,\nand life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine\nmerriment in his laugh.\n\n\"She's right; the lad _is_ lonely. I'll see what these little girls can\ndo for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked\nJo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the\nboy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\n\nIf the Laurences had been what Jo called \"prim and poky,\" she would not\nhave got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but\nfinding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\nimpression.",
  "50": " When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\nsomething more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which\nhad been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as\nshe went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either\nside, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and\ntrees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers\ntill his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy\nlook Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I\nlike the medicine she sent me very much.\"\n\n            [Illustration: Please give these to your mother]\n\nThey found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great\ndrawing-room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,\nwhich stood open.\n\n\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\nexpression.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\n\n\"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"\n\n\"Won't you first?\"\n\n\"Don't know how; too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"\n\nSo Laurie played, and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\nheliotrope and tea-roses. Her respect and regard for the \"Laurence boy\"\nincreased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn't put on\nany airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so; only\npraised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the\nrescue. \"That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugar-plums\nare not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well\nin more important things. Going? Well, I'm much obliged to you, and I\nhope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good-night, Doctor\nJo.\"\n\nHe shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\nWhen they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything\namiss. He shook his head.\n\n\"No, it was me; he doesn't like to hear me play.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't.\"\n\n\"No need of that; I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take care\nof yourself, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; but you will come again, I hope?\"\n\n\"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"\n\n\"I will.",
  "51": "\"Good-night, Laurie!\"\n\n\"Good-night, Jo, good-night!\"\n\nWhen all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt\ninclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\nattractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\nwanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him;\nMeg longed to walk in the conservatory; Beth sighed for the grand piano;\nand Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\n\n\"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\nwho was of an inquiring disposition.\n\n\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\nmarried an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\nis very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did\nnot like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died\nwhen Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.\nI fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old\nman is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes\nnaturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare\nsay his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\nrate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\n'glowered,' as Jo said.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\n\n\"How silly!\" said Jo. \"Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not\nplague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"\n\n\"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\nsuppose. Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\nsentimental.\n\n\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to\nhim, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was _not_ sentimental.\n\n\"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\nbehave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent\nhim.\"\n\n\"He meant the blanc-mange, I suppose.\"\n\n\"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\nbefore.\n\n\"I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get it,\"\nsaid Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.\n\n\"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly,\nand spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy, and I like him, and I won't have\nany sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.",
  "52": " We'll all be\ngood to him, because he hasn't got any mother, and he _may_ come over\nand see us, mayn't he, Marmee?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\nremember that children should be children as long as they can.\"\n\n\"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,\" observed\nAmy. \"What do you say, Beth?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progress,'\" answered Beth, who had\nnot heard a word. \"How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket\nGate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying; and that\nmaybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our\nPalace Beautiful.\"\n\n\"We have got to get by the lions, first,\" said Jo, as if she rather\nliked the prospect.\n\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\n\n\n\n\n                                  VI.\n\n                    BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL.\n\n\nThe big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for\nall to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.\nLaurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something\nfunny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with\ntheir mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The\nother lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this\nmade them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,\nafter a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and\ncould not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\nmotherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\nthat humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and\ninterchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\n\nAll sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new\nfriendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and\nhe privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\nsplendid girls.\" With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the\nsolitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found\nsomething very charming in the innocent companionship of these\nsimple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick\nto feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively\nways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of\nbooks, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged\nto make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing\ntruant, and running over to the Marches.",
  "53": "\"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards,\" said\nthe old gentleman. \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\nhard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is\nright, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\ngrandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't\nget into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is\ndoing more for him than we can.\"\n\nWhat good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such\nsleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\nparlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg\ncould walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\nbouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\nold gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\nbeauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in\nthe most delightful style.\n\nBut Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\ncourage to go to the \"Mansion of Bliss,\" as Meg called it. She went once\nwith Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared\nat her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so loud,\nthat he frightened her so much her \"feet chattered on the floor,\" she\ntold her mother; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there\nany more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements\ncould overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in\nsome mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the\nbrief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and\ntalked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had\nheard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to\nstay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if\nfascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,\nwith her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of\nthis unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had\nbeen a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers;\nand presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.\nMarch,--\n\n\"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\ntoo fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use.",
  "54": " Wouldn't some of\nyour girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to\nkeep it in tune, you know, ma'am?\"\n\nBeth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep\nfrom clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the\nthought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath\naway. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd\nlittle nod and smile,--\n\n\"They needn't see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I'm\nshut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great\ndeal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine\no'clock.\"\n\nHere he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\nlast arrangement left nothing to be desired. \"Please tell the young\nladies what I say; and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.\"\nHere a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\nface full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--\n\n\"O sir, they do care, very, very much!\"\n\n             [Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]\n\n\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as he\nlooked down at her very kindly.\n\n\"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody\nwill hear me--and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude, and\ntrembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\n\n\"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum\naway as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\n\n\"How kind you are, sir!\"\n\nBeth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was\nnot frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because\nshe had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.\nThe old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,\nstooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--\n\n\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear!\nGood day, madam;\" and away he went, in a great hurry.\n\nBeth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\nglorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.\nHow blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,\nbecause she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\nher sleep.",
  "55": " Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of\nthe house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\nside-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the\ndrawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some\npretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and\nfrequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\ninstrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\nelse but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\nlike the voice of a beloved friend.\n\nShe stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no\nappetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state\nof beatitude.\n\nAfter that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every\nday, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that\ncame and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his\nstudy-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie\nmount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected\nthat the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were\nput there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about\nmusic at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that\nhelped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what\nisn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.\nPerhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a\ngreater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.\n\n        [Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]\n\n\"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so\nkind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do\nit?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\n\n\"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking\nhim. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making\nup,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's\nrequests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.\n\nAfter many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\nthe materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet\ncheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very\nappropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with\noccasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,\nand they were finished before any one got tired of them.",
  "56": " Then she wrote\na very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on\nto the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\n\nWhen this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All\nthat day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment\narrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety\nfriend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\nerrand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As\nshe came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads\npopping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\nseveral hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--\n\n\"Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\"\n\n\"O Beth, he's sent you--\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;\nbut she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.\n\nBeth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters\nseized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\npointing, and all saying at once, \"Look there! look there!\" Beth did\nlook, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a\nlittle cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,\nlike a sign-board, to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"\n\n\"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should\ntumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\n\n\"Yes; all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you\nthink he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the\nletter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\" cried\nJo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.\n\n\"You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!\" and Beth\nhid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\n\nJo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\nwere,--\n\n    \"MISS MARCH:\n\n        \"_Dear Madam_,--\"\n\n\"How nice it sounds! I wish some one would write to me so!\" said Amy,\nwho thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\n\n    \"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had\n    any that suited me so well as yours,'\" continued Jo.\n    \"'Heart's-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always\n    remind me of the gentle giver.",
  "57": " I like to pay my debts; so I\n    know you will allow \"the old gentleman\" to send you something\n    which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With\n    hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain,\n\n    \"'Your grateful friend and humble servant,\n\n                                        \"'JAMES LAURENCE.'\"\n\n\"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me\nhow fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept\nall her little things carefully. Just think, he's given you her piano.\nThat comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying to\nsoothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever\nbeen before.\n\n\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\npuckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\nstool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\nits beauties.\n\n\"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'; only think of his writing that\nto you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid,\" said Amy,\nmuch impressed by the note.\n\n\"Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby-pianny,\" said Hannah,\nwho always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\n\nSo Beth tried it; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano\never heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\norder; but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the\nhappiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\ntouched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\npedals.\n\n\"You'll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke; for the\nidea of the child's really going never entered her head.\n\n\"Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking\nabout it.\" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\nwalked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\nLaurences' door.\n\n\"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The\npianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her right mind,\"\ncried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\nspeechless by the miracle.\n\nThey would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\nafterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the\nstudy-door before she gave herself time to think; and when a gruff voice\ncalled out, \"Come in!\" she did go in, right up to Mr.",
  "58": " Laurence, who\nlooked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\nsmall quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for--\" But she\ndidn't finish; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech,\nand, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put\nboth arms round his neck, and kissed him.\n\n    [Illustration: She put both arms around his neck and kissed him]\n\nIf the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\nwouldn't have been more astonished; but he liked it,--oh, dear, yes, he\nliked it amazingly!--and was so touched and pleased by that confiding\nlittle kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his\nknee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he\nhad got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him\nfrom that moment, and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had\nknown him all her life; for love casts out fear, and gratitude can\nconquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate,\nshook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again,\nlooking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\ngentleman, as he was.\n\nWhen the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of\nexpressing her satisfaction; Amy nearly fell out of the window in her\nsurprise; and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, \"Well, I do believe\nthe world is coming to an end!\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  VII.\n\n                      AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.\n\n\n                      [Illustration: The Cyclops]\n\n\"That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he?\" said Amy, one day, as Laurie\nclattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\n\n\"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? and very handsome\nones they are, too,\" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about\nher friend.\n\n\"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need fire\nup when I admire his riding.\"\n\n\"Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she called him\na Cyclops,\" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\n\n\"You needn't be so rude; it's only a 'lapse of lingy,' as Mr. Davis\nsays,\" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. \"I just wish I had a\nlittle of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\" she added, as if to\nherself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.",
  "59": "\"Why?\" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's\nsecond blunder.\n\n\"I need it so much; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to\nhave the rag-money for a month.\"\n\n\"In debt, Amy? What do you mean?\" and Meg looked sober.\n\n\"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you\nknow, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\nat the shop.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking\nbits of rubber to make balls;\" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,\nAmy looked so grave and important.\n\n\"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\nbe thought mean, you must do it, too. It's nothing but limes now, for\nevery one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading\nthem off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at\nrecess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she's mad\nwith her, she eats one before her face, and don't offer even a suck.\nThey treat by turns; and I've had ever so many, but haven't returned\nthem; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know.\"\n\n\"How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking\nout her purse.\n\n\"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat\nfor you. Don't you like limes?\"\n\n\"Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long\nas you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I'll have a\ngrand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate\nabout taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering\nfor one.\"\n\nNext day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the\ntemptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\nparcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\nDuring the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four\ndelicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,\ncirculated through her \"set,\" and the attentions of her friends became\nquite overwhelming.",
  "60": " Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the\nspot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and\nJenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her\nlimeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish\nanswers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's\ncutting remarks about \"some persons whose noses were not too flat to\nsmell other people's limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud\nto ask for them;\" and she instantly crushed \"that Snow girl's\" hopes by\nthe withering telegram, \"You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for\nyou won't get any.\"\n\nA distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and\nAmy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe\nrankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the\nairs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a\nfall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.\nNo sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed\nhimself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,\ninformed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her\ndesk.\n\nNow Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\nvowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\nlaw. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\na long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\nnewspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\ndistortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\none man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys\nare trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are\ninfinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical\ntempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis\nknew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so\nhe was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and\nexamples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most\nunfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had\nevidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east\nwind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done\nhim the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the\nexpressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, \"he was as\nnervous as a witch and as cross as a bear."
